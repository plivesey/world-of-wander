                <div>Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam are extremely different from one another, in ways we couldn't have predicted before visiting. Thailand is by far the richest of them, and was never part of the Indochina colonial territories ruled by the French (which included Cambodia as well as Vietnam and Laos). But we didn't realize just how poor and remote Laos was before we went – very different from the bustling cities and tour busses of Vietnam.</div>

                <div>We decided to fly into Luang Prabang and not take any busses into or around the country, because we'd heard the road quality was terrible (I get horribly carsick). We didn't know that it's because there were no roads going into the country until nearly this century – the slow boat down the Mekong was, until recently, the only way in and out.</div>

                <div>After meeting so many quiet and kind people in a city that was clearly on the verge of tipping into over-touristed, then learning how desperately poor the nation is, my heart pretty much melted. On our last night, we ate dinner in a spectacular Western-owned Lao barbecue place called Lao Lao Garden, and the owner had written a guide to Laos in the back of the menu that we found incredibly illuminating and sad. Afterward, we raced to the night market just before it closed and I picked out four pillowcases and gave the woman the first price she asked for. I wish we had had more space and weight allocation in our bags – everything at the night market was beautiful, and it was heartbreaking to know that when a tourist haggles down to a "cheap" price, that could mean the difference between sending a kid to school or not.</div>

                <div>Rather than summarize or act like an expert, I'm sharing that FAQs page in full. It certainly made me think hard about how I conduct myself when traveling around places with vastly different lifestyles than my own, and glad that we have chosen not to go to hard-partying destinations like Vang Vieng and the full moon party in Thailand. It also gave me a lot more empathy for Thai people, where tourists have overrun the country and acted terribly a lot of the time – especially in regards to the sex trade. On our flight back from Luang Prabang to Bangkok, the man sitting in the aisle seat of our row got incredibly upset and ranted about Americans when we neglected to thank him for getting out of his seat so we could use the toilet. It was clearly about a lot more than a thank you.</div>

                        <li>This is NOT Ibiza! Nor is it <a href="http://travel.cnn.com/explorations/life/24-signs-partys-over-vang-vieng-965782/">Vang Vieng</a>... tread lightly on the thousands of years of living culture here. <i>Always</i> dress modestly in the city. Have fun, but refrain from loud, boisterous behavior in the city, especially after 10 p.m. Also, this is not Thailand; there is no sex industry and you can only legally have sex with locals if you marry them.</li>
                        <li>Don't treat the monks like monkeys in a zoo. Be respectful if you take photos. NEVER touch them. Observe, but don't participate in the morning "takbat" almsgiving, unless with a local and you prepare the offering yourself. Do NOT buy anything from the morning vendors! Soon there will be more Lao people selling sticky rice to tourists than there are Lao people giving it to the monks themselves!</li>
                        <li>(<i>Bold added by me</i>) <b>Please keep your perspective. You are in one of the most remote and poorest countries in the world. When you argue over a few thousand kip, you're arguing about a few cents with people who are so poor that when they or their loved ones get sick, they die. Look around – how many old people do you see? You're being "ripped off" for pennies by people who have nothing but the smile on their face.</b></li>

We have to be closed by 11:30 p.m. to allow enough time for employees and guests to be home by curfew. These laws are loosely enforced for tourists. However, business owners can be fined up to $2,000, incarcerated, and lose their business license.</div>

                <div>We recommend that you tip our staff 5+%, or at least leave your small change, if you are happy with their service. Tips are shared by the entire staff every month and we match (double) the tips you give as a bonus. If you have heard that tipping is not traditional in Laos, please consider that the average income in Laos is still less than $1,000/YEAR and full-service restaurants with Western standards are also not traditional. Our staff uses the tip income to pay for education and basic health care that their families could not otherwise afford.</div>

                <div>In Laos, all food is served in the middle of the table and is shared by everyone. It is considered extremely rude to pull an entire order in front of oneself. The concept of possession is completely foreign to the Lao people. To illustrate this point, the word for "mine" and "yours" is the same in Lao and there isn't even a word for an individual person. Laos is perhaps best described as "communalist."</div>

                <div>If you live like a local, you can live on one dollar a day! Stay with 10 people in a bamboo hut with no water or electricity, grow your own food, rarely eat meat, drink only water and lao lao, bathe and do laundry in the river, and whatever you do, don't get sick! The ONLY things made in Laos are basic farm crops, handicrafts, textiles, wood products, cement, electricity, cigarettes, beer, and soft drinks. <i>Absolutely everything else must be imported.</i> You are in a place so remote it was not accessible by road until nearly the 21st century! Most area businesses operate at laughably small profits to stay competitive. We have to pay the same prices for products as in Thailand – plus the increased cost due to resellers, taxes, and shipping. Anything "modern" costs 2 to 10 times more than in a developed country. Local inflation averages 10+%. Most importantly, property values are spiralling out of control – our rent increased nearly 4,000% in nine years!</div>
