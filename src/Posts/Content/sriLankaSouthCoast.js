                <div>Before arriving in Colombo, Sri Lanka, we had done almost zero planning. This was the first part of our year(s) off when we'd be truly backpacking in Southeast Asia, living up to the stereotype. Before, we'd had a large suitcase in addition to the backpacks, and left it at our home base in <a href="https://worldofwander.app/post/saigon">Saigon</a>. When our parents came to visit at the end of January, we sent the suitcase back with my mom, and when we got to Colombo, the first item of business was to send home a box with the cold weather clothing we'd needed for Nepal and couldn't lug around for the next two months. It turned out that we accidentally went to the employees-only FedEx office in the industrial part of town, where it took over an hour to get everything sent home. Oops.</div>

                <div>Everything I read online about Sri Lanka said to skip Colombo, but I'm glad we had a day to spend there. My sister Kirstin flew out to visit us and arrived nearly 24 hours after we did, so Peter and I went into the city center for our first afternoon. Our plan was to rent bikes at Viharamahadevi Park and cycle to the famous Galle Face boardwalk, but the bike stand was closed (and judging by the layers of rust on the bikes, had been for some time). As we wandered looking at the trees, a groundskeeper approached and started showing us around. He had worked at the park for 35 years and still carried around his original badge with a youthful picture of himself.</div>

                <div>As we quickly learned, when someone approaches you in Sri Lanka offering to show you something or help you, they often expect payment or a tip at the end. When we asked at the end of his tour if we could tip him, the man audaciously asked "You have ten U.S. dollars?" and got increasingly insistent. It could have soured the interaction, but we had honestly had a great time and he had showed us a bunch of cool stuff – the best being a pack of gigantic migratory bats that live by day in the park's trees. These beasts were HUGE! Practically the Great Animal from <i>The Swan Princess</i> (Disney, anyone?)</div>

                <div>We walked to Galle Face as the sun started to set, bathing the ocean and boardwalk in gorgeous light. At Breeze Barracuda, we grabbed a couple of drinks and watched a game of cricket on the green. It looked pretty casual, and seems like an easy sport from an outsider's perspective. But as we went to catch our tuk-tuk Uber, one of the players ran onto the sidewalk to chase the ball, and threw it back with a wildly swinging arm and such extreme force that I stepped back in panic.</div>

                <div>After Kirstin had arrived and we'd dealt with FedEx in the morning, we caught a ride down to Koggala, a beach just past the larger Galle and Unawatuna area. A note on Ubers, if you're going to Sri Lanka (go ahead and skip this if not!) Uber exists there, but is not without issues. For our first airport ride, we got matched with a driver who called us and asked us to cancel, then pay him the full amount directly so he didn't have to give Uber a cut. This made me extremely uncomfortable, since safety is the primary reason I use ride sharing apps abroad – I want a digital record of where I am. We also tried to use the new InterCity feature from the industrial FedEx, but got continual error messages – and had to call the shady Uber driver from the night before. We did use it successfully later in the trip, which was a welcome break from needing to haggle for every ride.</div>

                <div>Kirstin only had five full days in Sri Lanka, and wanted to see both the south coast and the center of the country, so we decided to only spend two nights in Koggala and drive up to Ella on our third day. If we'd had more time, I would have loved to spend a couple more days in the area. There's a cool laid-back vibe, the beautiful historic Dutch fort in Galle, lots of activities (swimming with turtles, yoga, windsurfing etc.), and plenty of spots to grab a local Lion beer and watch the sun set.</div>

                <div>On our first evening in Koggala, we hit up the top thing Kirstin had wanted to see in Sri Lanka: the stilt fishermen. While the coast was beautiful and their craft very impressive, it's been very much changed by tourism. We didn't see any of the fisherman actually fishing, unless you count the guy who climbed up onto the stilt with a dead fish already hooked on his line and jiggled it around for the tourists to "catch." They can make far more money asking people to pay for a photograph instead of selling fish, so understandably have shifted to that. When you get close to them, a guy on the beach will either ask for money or point and shout if you've already gotten your camera out. We shrugged, paid and got a photo, and headed off for happy hour, as yet another tour bus pulled up to the beach and its passengers beelined for the fishermen.</div>

                <div>In the morning, we got up early and caught a tuk-tuk to Galle to see the fort at sunrise. It was gorgeous, peaceful, and quiet. Next up was a yoga class in Unawatuna, at Yoga with Asiri. His class was great – he teaches Shivananda yoga which emphasizes mobility and stretching, and we tried some tough poses at the end. It was the first time I'd successfully done a headstand! Peter struggled with the flexibility, but wowed Asiri with the peacock pose – like a bent-arm plank, where you hold your body horizontal balancing on only your hands. Little did Asiri know that Peter regularly practices the no-feet push-up and did not just pull that out of his a**.</div>

                <div>Both nights, we ate dinner at Schöne Beach House, which catered mostly to German tourists. Kirstin and I both speak some German, and when the owner found that out, he chatted to us for half an hour. He had moved to Germany at 19 and only come back to Sri Lanka recently, so was completely fluent and cheekily suggested we could come back to improve our skills. Then a manager came by, and he spoke German too, because his son had married a German woman who had fallen in love while traveling. The son and daughter-in-law had kids now, and the man had been to Germany four times. We met several Sri Lankans with ties to Germany, saw and heard of a few couples, and met a lot of German tourists – clearly it's their hot and beachy destination of choice.</div>

                <div>If we'd had time, I would have liked to stay in Mirissa – the small bit of it we saw while driving through looked like a hippy surfer town with lots of murals and smoothie spots. If we'd had more money, I would for sure have splurged on a nice hotel with attached spa inside the Dutch fort area. (I'd recommend to mostly skip Unawatuna – mediocre and overpriced food spots, and we got scammed on a bottle of Nivea SPF 50 sunscreen that turned out to be filled with fake stuff and gave us all horrible sunburns. Win some, lose some!) Overall, we really enjoyed our time down there, and it would have been cool to go even further east towards Tangalle, the safari park of Yala, and up the eastern coast to surfer spot Arugam Bay. But it's always good to leave a few things for a potential future return!</div>
