                <div>Slovenia is maybe where Iceland was at in 2014. Before the infrastructure expanded to accommodate a massive tourist boom, but after avid travelers all bookmarked it as their next spot. We originally intended to go around in a camper van – but they were completely booked up online. Also, we read that to get a camping spot, you have to show up in the morning as the previous night's campers were leaving because competition was so tight.</div>

                <div>Standing at the top of a steep ascent to the Mala Osojnica viewpoint, our legs were already feeling sore – but it was worth it. Lake Bled is famous for having Slovenia's only island, a tiny rocky perch in the middle of the lake with a church built on top. It's unbelievably picturesque. From the viewpoint, we could see a bright turquoise area of shallow water, where swimmers embarked to go to the island. When we got down, we fetched our swimsuits and had a lie-down on a patch of grass packed with happy locals and tourists.</div>

                <div>Nearby Lake Bohinj sees fewer tourists, but its western end – near the parking lot for Savica waterfall – is stunning. Sadly, this time we didn't have our suits with us, so after a short walk up and down from the waterfall, we just took off our shoes and sat on the gravel spit jealously watching the swimmers. The water was refreshingly chilly, and we spent at least twenty minutes watching a school of minnows swirl around the shallows eating bits of bread. That night, we ate at the only restaurant on the south side of Lake Bled, Restavracija Sova, and had our first taste of Slovenian white wine.</div>

                <div>Kranjska Gora is an amazing base for mountain activities, with tons of trails for hiking and biking. It's central to several alpine lakes, including the dazzlingly green Lake Zelenci (which literally means "green"), Lake Jasna just south of the town, and the two Lagi di Fusine just twenty minutes away across the Italian border. In the early mornings and sunsets, we made sure to be near one of these to watch the sharp mountain peaks light up in golds, pinks, and purples. On our first day, we racked up 28,000 steps without even getting on one of the main trails.</div>

                <div>The entire Trglaski National Park – which Kranjska Gora and Bovec are the two most popular bases for – felt very much like the alpine areas in France, Switzerland, and Italy that we'd passed through while hiking the <a href="https://worldofwander.app/post/hiking-tour-du-mont-blanc">Tour du Mont Blanc</a>. To get between them, we had to drive through Italy. While the towns look the same on either side, we were surprised to learn that there were vicious sieges during WWI fought in the mountains between Italy and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It's fascinating that while that little Northeast corner of Italy is so close and similar to Slovenia, the languages are so different – at some point, we assume they might have been more similar, before Italian was standardized across the principalities. Or perhaps the divide goes all the way back to Roman times? We both admitted that we know pathetically little about the history of this corner (despite my majoring in Eastern European History!! It was mostly Russian, OK?). </div>

                <div>On one hike, the Čelo Fortress Trail in Bovec, the fortress in question was built and only used during WWI. Now, it's home to a little family of goats. I had one of the moments of purest joy in my life: as we sat covered in sweat looking at the view, the goats suddenly darted out of the bushes and began vigorously licking my arms, legs, and neck. Peter quickly scampered away but I was in heaven. They didn't like it when I tried to pet them – it was clear they were just using me for my salty flavor – so I just sat there and squealed with glee for about four minutes straight.</div>

                <div>We also tried a non-hiking adventure on the famous Soča River: <a href="http://en.sportmix.si/home.html">rafting</a>! In a funny coincidence, we were paired up with a couple from California, Natalie and Nico – two of the only four Americans we ran into while in Slovenia. (It's incredibly popular with Germans, Austrians, and Italians who can drive there, but still hasn't reached Iceland levels for Americans.) Our raft was the most adventurous of the bunch so even though the water level was pretty low at the end of the summer, our guide Barney spun us around and tried to flip us over rocks constantly, while we chanted our team cry: "Borscht!!!" Barney, despite being Hungarian, had never heard of borscht, and was horrified by the thought of a purple cabbage soup, making the chant even funnier.</div>

                <div>After a few days full of hiking and other outdoor adventures, we were very ready to do nothing but drink wine at our next location: Vipava Valley. The area is one of just two wine regions in Slovenia; the other is Goriška Brda. Neither is very well known outside of Slovenia, and with their signature wine being "Orange Wine", we thought they might be a bit kitschy and only decent on taste.</div>

            text: (
                <div>But, we were pleasantly surprised! The reason the wines are not well known outside of Slovenia is that traditionally, vineyards were grown by individual families for their own (copious) consumption. Each family typically had a vegetable garden and kept pigs to make their own prosciutto, pancetta, and other dried meats – no smoker needed, since the area is very dry and windy. But until the socialist period of Yugoslavian unity, the government banned growing grapes for individual use. When we asked our guide why, he shrugged and said that of course it had to do with corruption, and the government wanting to own the valuable commodities.</div>

            text: (
                <div>So the vineyards today have regrown from the few vines that were left over at the end of the 20th century. They're mostly still owned by and intended for individual families, but some wineries are beginning to expand and sell to restaurants across Slovenia. One winemaker we spoke to said that when they try to export internationally, the quantities they offer are so low that they have a hard time making deals. Apparently, the Japanese and Estonians love the Zelen ("green") varietal because of how well it pairs with fish – so maybe soon, it will make an international debut! Zelen and Ribula are the two varietals grown only in Slovenia, and are protected – like Champagne – so they are the only place that can produce it.</div>

                <div>On our afternoon tour with Winestronaut, the only tour agency in the region, we visited two family wineries – one of the largest of the area, and one of the smallest - both amazing. Almost all wine tasting is done at family estates and needs to be arranged ahead of time, so we were glad to go with a guide. In the center of Vipava town, there's only one tasting room: <a href="http://www.wipach.si/wine.html">Wipach</a>. Anja, who co-owns with her husband, picked up the family tradition of making wine and decided to go commercial six years ago. Despite the fact that she's doing a brisk business in the tasting room and recently purchased a building right on the main square so they could do all the production there as well, she still works a day job as a teacher in a town 45 minutes away.</div>

                <div>With Slovenia coming up on the tourist circuit, Vipava and Goriška Brda are going to have to deal with an influx of people where the infrastructure isn't there yet. We got the sense that there was a bit of tension between Wipach's approach of taking the winery downtown and making it more accessible, versus the family wine estates that do tastings mainly through relationships with Winestronaut – but maybe we're speculating incorrectly off comments we heard about the dangers of tourism growing too fast.</div>

                <div>One last tidbit from Vipava: we rented bikes from Anja's neighbor David, whose number was posted on a piece of paper in the window of Wipach. As we strapped our backpack down, we noticed that my bike had 'Aurora, Oregon' written across it. At the risk of sounding too cheesy, I guess you're never too far from home.</div>
