                <div>As soon as we decided to take this year off to travel, we knew we wanted to go back to Iceland. We'd done 6 days there in 2013, and that trip is what really sparked the travel bug. On that first trip we stayed every night in Reykjavik and did day trips around the south and west; this time, we wanted to drive around the Ring Road and do a trek through the Highlands to see the entire country.</div>
