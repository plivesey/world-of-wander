                <div>I'd seen many beautiful pictures of Sri Lanka, and the top thing I couldn't wait to see in person was the railroad from Ella to Kandy. Most tourists who come to Sri Lanka for one week land in Colombo, go straight to Kandy, and take it east; we hoped that by going the opposite direction, we'd have less competition for tickets and seats (as I mentioned <a href="https://worldofwander.app/post/srilanka-south-coast">earlier</a>, we did not plan very far in advance for this trip).</div>

                <div>Ella turned out to be our favorite place in the country. The famous and beautiful Nine Arch bridge is right next to the town, as are two hikes to viewpoints – Little Adam's Peak and Ella Rock – and the train station is right in town. Ella is really small and seemingly used to be a hidden gem, but has been transformed into a highly-visited granola tourist spot with lots of beanbag lounges and shops selling elephant pants. After four days on our backpacker budget staying in non-AC rooms and eating cheap Sri Lankan food, my sister Kirstin (visiting us for a week) wanted champagne – and we found it there two nights in a row. You gotta splurge sometimes!</div>

                <div>Our guesthouse breakfast introduced us to Sri Lanka rotti with sambol – rotti being a naan-like dense round patty, and sambol a blitzed coconut-based relish that you traditionally put on top of daal. YUM. After breakfast our first morning there, we tuk-tukked up to 98 Acres hotel for a yoga class in a hut overlooking a tea-growing valley. The morning views were beautiful, and the birds chirping was the real version of that soundtrack your teacher puts on in urban yoga classes.</div>

                <div>We walked up to Little Adam's Peak afterward, having read that it was only 10 minutes walk to the peak from 98 Acres. The internet lied! Granted we are terrible at hot climates and walked really slowly, and went beyond the initial peak to the furthest end, but still – we were on the mountain nearly 2 hours.</div>

                <div>At the base of the peak, a new spot had set up shop and become instantly successful: a zipline. We had actually been seated next to the founders the night before at our beanbag-and-champagne spot, and they said they'd seen over 3000 people come in the first month. It was obvious why when we saw it in person: right after you've climbed this hot steep hill, it seems like a fantastic idea to pay $20 for 34 seconds of breeze and freedom. You bet we signed up for it and went later that afternoon. Well, Kirstin and I did. Peter hates heights, so he went on a solo man hike to Ella Rock instead.</div>

                <div>At sunset, we tuk-tukked over to Nine Arch Bridge. In Ella, the tuk-tuk drivers have banded together and decided on a set price of 500 rupees to get anywhere; you cannot barter with them. We managed to get a slight discount for a roundtrip if the guy would wait for us, but ended up hiking partway back in the dark when he didn't show. Despite that, the bridge was a huge highlight of our trip. It's curved across a little steep valley and surrounded by violently green trees and tea plants. It's made from stone, bricks, and cement – no steel – and is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Arch_Bridge,_Demodara">"one of the best examples of colonial-era railway construction in the country."</a> We watched as a brilliantly blue train came through right before the sun fully set, rolling gently past the people sitting on the edge of the bridge.</div>

                <div>After two nights in Ella, we got up early once more to catch the 6:40 a.m. train to Nuwara Eliya, halfway to Kandy. We were able to get first-class tickets two days in advance, which means a guaranteed seat and air conditioning. Locals and a lot of tourists will show up within an hour of departure for a second or third class ticket. They go for as low as $1 and have the benefit of open windows (for sticking cameras out of) but the risk of not getting a seat. Due to the popularity of the Kandy-Ella route, you can now book first-class tickets online up to 30 days in advance, or in person at any station. Lots of blogs tell you which side of the train to sit on for the best views, but from my experience it didn't really matter – both are gorgeous at different points.</div>

                <div>After Nine Arch bridge, riding the train was my second favorite part of Sri Lanka. You pass by beautiful countryside the whole route and meet people standing in the doorways, which you're allowed to open, lean out of, or even sit on the edge of. Safety is not a high concern (and you should be careful – lots of Sri Lankans and a few tourists are injured or killed every year on the tracks) but it does make for wind in your face and a lot of joyful beauty.</div>

                <div>In Nuwara Eliya, we hired a man named Priyantha to drive us the 20 minutes from Nanu Oya station to the town. When he dropped us off and gave us his number, he offered to take us around anywhere we wanted for the afternoon and to let him know if we needed any long-distance rides. Kirstin booked him to go all the way to Colombo in the middle of the night for her morning flight, and after a short rest and wifi break, he took us on an afternoon tour of the waterfalls and tea plantations around Nuwara Eliya. I'm not sure when he slept! While we often had frustrating interactions with drivers in Sri Lanka, and always had to answer the set questions ("Where you from?" "How long in Sri Lanka?", "Where next?", and without fail, finally, "Need a driver? I have a good price"), there are some wonderfully helpful people out there. Thank you, Priyantha!</div>

                <div>After viewing them from the train, the car, and by foot, Peter and I have decided that the tea plantations of central Sri Lanka are underrated. They are gorgeous in person but tend to come out poorly in photos, the brilliant green looking a bit gaudy. As Peter put it, "God overdid the saturation on this one." At Blue Field Tea Mansion, we took a short tour of the factory. It has stood for nearly 100 years and still uses one original 112-year-old machine from Galway, Ireland. Afterwards, we were free to walk around the tea plants in the hills. Everywhere, the women picking tea were acutely aware of how touristy their jobs had become, and fairly requested money if you wanted a picture of them working (sometimes kindly, and sometimes preemptively and aggressively). They wear traditional clothes and have beautiful faces lined with sun and wrinkles from years of working outside, and indeed are incredibly photogenic.</div>

                <div>After Kirstin left in the middle of the night for her morning flight, Peter and I tried to sleep in. We had gotten up for sunrise nearly every morning this week. Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful at sleeping past 7 a.m. Since we had a train to Kandy in the evening, we decided to spend the day just moving slowly and catching up on things from a coffee shop.</div>

                <div>Nuwara Eliya is a small town, nicknamed "Little England" for its climate, gardens, and many colonial-era vacation houses. As it turns out, there's not much to do in the small town itself. We had gone to The Grand Hotel for drinks and dinner with Kirstin our first night, and Peter and I returned there in the morning for an air-conditioned cafe spot. It's a beautiful building that dates all the way back to 1823, when it was the colonial governor's vacation house. When we could no longer stand the incredibly slow wifi and had at least booked a place to stay that night in Kandy, we walked down to the old racetrack area. Horses wandered about freely, and it was oddly both busy and barren.</div>
