                <div>Since going to Montenegro on our honeymoon two years ago, I've wanted to return and explore this beautiful region. We rented a car to have the most flexibility and to be able to access hiking spots and small towns. As a result, I feel like we got to see so much of these countries despite spending less than a week in each of them. Each of the Balkan countries deserves a 2-3 week trip; maybe sometime in the future we can go back and explore them at a slower pace. Despite the quick pace of the road trip, the Balkans are one of the highlights from our year and a half of travel. The people were incredibly kind, the landscapes were stunning, the Ottoman-influenced cities were fascinating, and we enjoyed sampling the local food (I love you, ćevapi!).</div>

                <div>We started our Balkans tour in Sarajevo, which took two days and three busses to reach from Slovenia. (Luckily, that was the end of our bus journeys.) We only booked two nights there, not expecting much, but it turned out to be my favorite city of the month. The Old Town dates back to the Ottoman times and is still structured similar to a Turkish bazaar. Cafe culture is huge – people sit outside drinking Bosnian coffee and smoking at all hours of the day, and there are cafes on every block. The city bears the scars of the Bosnian War and buildings still have bullet holes in them, but it feels like a city that's moving forward together - it's diverse, multi-ethnic, and a mix of Muslim and Christians. The economy hasn't recovered well yet but I hope that since people are 'discovering' Bosnia as a beautiful place to visit, that will change soon.</div>

                <div>In southern Bosnia, we spent two peaceful days in the lovely small town Trebinje. We saw almost no other tourists, ate some excellent ćevapi, and walked along the river at sunsets. It felt like a place you could easily slow down and stay for a week or two.</div>

                <div>Mostar is probably the most-visited place in Bosnia, because it's close enough to be a day trip from Dubrovnik and is famous for its spectacularly curved bridge in the center of town. Like Sarajevo, it's still pretty beat up – bullet holes and dilapidated buildings just streets away from the main tourist area. The cover image on this post is also from Mostar; it's one of the most beautiful places we've been. If we'd gotten there earlier in the day, we for sure would have swum in the river under the bridge! A few daredevils jump off it – it's one of the locations for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSfWHzQtLN4">Red Bull's Cliff Diving competition</a>.</div>

                <div>While the mountains in Serbia are softer – more forests and plains than peaks - it is still a beautiful place to explore nature. Hiking and camping don't seem to be as big there, and a lot of hiking trails just went along dirt or gravel roads shared with cars. Our top spot was definitely Uvac Canyon – hard to get to, almost no one there, and crazy beautiful. Cameras can only get a small section of the many hairpin turns of the canyon, so check out <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mirador+Uvac/@43.3580166,19.9585286,14.67z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x4757e5ffda886e17:0x3529a0056dc82ec1!2sUvac+Special+Nature+Reserve!8m2!3d43.4221665!4d19.9352382!3m4!1s0x4757e726925a8af9:0xa97a2877aea15c66!8m2!3d43.3591976!4d19.9653554">Google Maps</a> for an idea of how curvy it is!

                <div>From Serbia, we passed through the mountainous southern edge of Montenegro on our way to Albania. There's a massive mountain range that runs along the borders of those two countries as well as Kosovo, and a Tour du Mont Blanc-like multi-day hike you can do through the countries. As a result, the paths are fairly well-marked and for the scenery alone, it's a hikers paradise. We stayed in an adorable little cabin in Prokletije National Park, just a few feet larger than the bed, and completely wiped ourselves out with a steep hike up to the Albanian border and back. After Nepal (which really has to take the cake) it was the best hiking we did in 2019.</div>

Unfortunately at this point in our trip I came down with a bad cold and didn't leave the hotel in Lovćen. Peter hiked up to see the mausoleum, but we didn't go back at sunrise for photos - so <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=lovcen+national+park&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS775US775&sxsrf=ACYBGNQVZ41aRjEovCzfIFfKRHaraOHvrw:1568391773327&tbm=isch&source=iu&ictx=1&fir=2MgL_yIaLc7d4M%253A%252CRlJzHGBbDtlazM%252C_&vet=1&usg=AI4_-kRR8yToIkDi8kXlOuyo24A7CnoIXw&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwji7pHUms7kAhXEw6YKHV3UAUwQ9QEwAHoECAgQBg&biw=1280&bih=698#imgdii=ao2Y_a2qcHguoM:&imgrc=3K4b9VHz6sN9aM:&vet=1">check out these</a>.</div>

But our legs were completely wiped, and we just did a short hour or so around the village before calling it a day. Next up was Lake Shkodra Resort, a very cool campsite where we splurged on a lofted treehouse. Worth it.

At all times of day, people of all ages were out and about walking, sitting by the lake with an espresso, or using the playgrounds and outdoor gyms. I absolutely love that people congregated and spent leisure time in the park every day of the week – I don't think you see that many places in America, and it's awesome to have a communal second living room outside. We used our two days here to catch up on some work from cafes, and loved <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/E7E/@41.3184354,19.814148,16.01z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x1350310470fac5db:0x40092af10653720!2sTirana,+Albania!3b1!8m2!3d41.3275459!4d19.8186982!3m4!1s0x0:0x8906a1de171fccec!8m2!3d41.3232474!4d19.8243839">E7E</a> in particular. Overall our feelings were the most mixed about Albania compared to the former Yugoslavian countries – the driving and roads are truly atrocious and the landscape we saw was drier, browner, and flatter, which made traveling a little less enjoyable - but I'd love to see the Albanian Riviera in the south and go back to the sharp mountains.</div>

One exception was a centuries-old mosque that now houses the excellent National Archaeology Museum, where the main hall is filled with artifacts from the Thracian times.
