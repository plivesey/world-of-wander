                <div>Eighteen months ago when planning our honeymoon, we realized that our dreams for travel were so much larger than the three weeks we could get off work. Six months ago, we got on a one-way plane to England and started this new reality.</div>

                <div>We left the length of the trip open-ended, deciding we'd see how were liking the nomadic life and how much longer we wanted to continue. A few nights ago, sitting on a beach in one of the most beautiful parts of the world, we talked about how we felt 6 months in. Since we have different perspectives and takeaways, we've each written about them below.</div>

                <div>My favorite parts of travel so far have been renting the camper van in <a href="https://worldofwander.app/posts/iceland">Iceland</a> and living in <a href="https://worldofwander.app/posts/seAsia">Vietnam</a>. After our second trip there, Iceland remains my favorite country to visit. The scenery is otherworldly, and everything feels like a hidden gem. I loved the freedom of driving wherever we wanted and never having an itinerary or schedule.</div>

                <div>Though I have a small amount of experience living in different countries, moving to Vietnam has been something else entirely. Everything is new here! Every day, something surprises me or makes me laugh—someone driving up the wrong side of the road blaring their horn, feeling that a $2 beer is quite expensive, or being unsure if someone is laughing at you, with you, or was just infused with sudden joy. Ordering food is an adventure every time and we’ve met so many diverse people.</div>

                <div>The biggest thing I've gotten out of travel so far has been some perspective on life. It's so hard to step back and assess things when you're stuck in the craziness of work in San Francisco. Once we started traveling, we immediately felt a level of stress disappear from our lives and it just makes everything better. I can relax more, be more present and engaged, and have a renewed passion for learning new things.</div>

                <div>I've been really lucky to work with incredibly passionate people who have in turn, inspired me to work hard. But often, I've been passionate without perspective. Sometimes, my mind would just be consumed by big projects which in hindsight, really aren't that important. Because of this, I'm actually looking forward to returning to work and real life and trying to do better. I hope I can value my time better, and remember that things aren't quite as critical as they seem. Of course, I'm loving traveling and don't want to stop anytime soon! But when we do stop (and don't worry friends, at some point, we'll stop), I'm looking forward to having a bit more zen.</div>

                <div>When Peter asked me if I wanted to continue traveling indefinitely, I said of course. I feel incredibly lucky to be doing this right now and happier than I've ever been. I'm sure at some point I'll feel an itch to go home but… it hasn't hit yet! That's the biggest area we differ: I'm not yet excited about the return and would like to push it off as long as possible.</div>

                <div>I was nervous about two things before we started: getting tired of living out of a backpack and being on the move constantly, and losing closeness with friends back home. We solved the first problem by deciding to travel slowly, getting a homebase in Saigon so we could cook, leave things in a wardrobe, and make friends. That's been SUCH a great decision. I suppose it means that we're seeing fewer things, since we budgeted a lot of down time and are in Saigon about 2 weeks out of the month, but it's worth it.</div>

                <div>On my second concern, keeping up long-distance relationships when historically I have a terrible track record of this (sorry to all my high school and college friends…), it's been a lot better than I feared. One reason is social media – through <a href="https://www.instagram.com/acavery/">Instagram</a>, I can keep people up to date with where we are and have small, frequent chats through stories and DMs. For me, that's a lot easier than long phone calls, emails, or text chains. I also have been making a much bigger effort to text friends whenever I think of them. But, the main reason we would stop traveling to come back is that we both miss regularly seeing friends that we've known for years. (And, it's a bummer not to be with family for the holidays.)</div>

                <div>The biggest surprise for me is how much stress I was carrying around every day in San Francisco, and how different I feel now. It's not that my job was particularly stressful (I love you, your wonderful people, and your flexible work hours, Salesforce), it was just the combination of constantly buzzing around and being 'busy' and spending too much time frantically calling Ubers to get across the city and talking about tech or politics literally all the time and getting home late and hungry but there's nothing in the house to eat and the car needs fixing but there's no time and on and on and on.</div>

                <div>My mental health and happiness have improved a lot, and I am learning what things I need to keep stress in check. That's going to be a huge factor for me in building a new lifestyle when we get back. Mainly, I've learned how to slow down – I walk slower to look around, I don't react as hotly or emotionally to things, and I don't multitask. I have more time for reading and blew through my 2018 goal of 20 books back in July. I've also been exploring creative pursuits, which is something I haven't really made time for since high school.</div>

                <div>That said, we are both people who can't really sit still for too long. Most days when we're not on a trip, we're in a coffee shop for a few hours doing something productive – working on Peter's chess app, editing photos, writing for the blog, researching and planning trips, or editing the budget tracker. I'm contracting part-time and Peter is still involved with the developer world, including side projects and <a href='https://medium.com/@peterlivesey'>writing on Medium</a>. Hey Seattle, do you have any 20 hour workweek jobs with 6 weeks paid vacation for me?</div>

                <div>Lastly, the more I travel, the more I want to travel – but of course there's no way to see it all. The parts of our trip that I've enjoyed the most so far have mostly had to do with mountains and an aspect of hardship ending in reward – the entirety of <a href="https://worldofwander.app/posts/iceland">Iceland</a> (favorite country!), the <a href="https://worldofwander.app/post/hiking-tour-du-mont-blanc">Tour du Mont Blanc</a>, the <a href="https://worldofwander.app/post/lake-district">Lake District in England</a>, <a href="https://worldofwander.app/post/seattle-olympic-peninsula">Olympic National Park</a>, and motorbiking the hills around Cao Bang and <a href="https://worldofwander.app/post/ninh-binh">Ninh Binh</a> in Vietnam. My leg is finally on the mend and all I want to do is plan more big treks around the world, but we don't have a ton of space in our 2019 plans for them. Obviously whenever we finish being nomads this time around, we won't be done with traveling, so I'll just keep making plans. And who knows, maybe after another 4 years of work we'll quit and do it all over again!</div>
