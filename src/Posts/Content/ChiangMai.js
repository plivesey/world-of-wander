                <div>In a lot of cases, I can suss out how I feel about a city just from the airplane's approach and the taxi ride into the city. So much of what makes me like a place is the architecture and trees on the streets – I can be quick to love a place and look for the best parts of it just because I get that initial good vibe. That's how I felt about Chiang Mai when we landed in December.</div>

                <div>Our plane touched down before lunch, and since our room wasn't yet ready, our first item of business was to lounge on the guesthouse's outdoor couch to wait and order food. We didn't get out and about until close to 3 p.m., and our only item for the afternoon was to find a cozy cafe with fast wifi to get some work done. Through our week in Chiang Mai, we would frequently spend an afternoon looking for nothing more than that, seeing the Old Town's temples and ancient city gates as we walked in search of coffee and food.</div>

                <div>Nearly everyone who’d told us about Chiang Mai said they loved it, but one woman we met in Koh Lanta had not. She hadn't learned to ride a motorbike, so had stayed within the city the whole month she was there, and said it was actually a pretty big, bustling place. It wasn't until we flew out of Chiang Mai at the end of the week that we saw the city sprawl and tall buildings she had referenced. Within the Old Town, it felt like stepping back in time. It's kept its old walls and moat, few buildings are over four stories tall, there's little vehicle traffic, and it's very walkable. Every cafe and restaurant seems to be tucked in an alley with unintentionally shabby-chic furniture, at least one roaming cat, several lanterns, and tons of plants.</div>

                <div>The coffee scene in Chiang Mai is going strong. I read on one cafe's website that it's because Chiang Mai is one of the few places in Southeast Asia where the fields of coffee plants and roasters are less than an hour apart, so coffee makers get very invested in the quality of the plants and beans. One day, I walked for 45 minutes along the northern wall of the Old Town and through the quiet streets of a neighborhood with no tourists, on my way to a cafe called Akha Ama for a street photography class. It could have been straight out of Seattle or San Francisco, with groups of people huddled working, minimalist design, porch seats, and vegan sweet treats.</div>

                <div>Handicrafts in Chiang Mai are made by ethnic minorities across the north of Thailand. They are truly beautiful, and very different to the crafts we see in Vietnam. There are quite a lot of hippy clothes too, next to vivid red, purple, and blue traditional dresses and wraps. Indigo is used frequently, and dyed in patterns similar to tie-dye or ikat. My flip-flops from Koh Yao Noi (complete pieces of crap) finally broke on our first day in Chiang Mai, so I happily bought a pair of hand-dyed indigo sandals.</div>

                <div>On the food front, we made it our mission to eat khao soi from as many vendors and restaurants as possible. Our friends Fiona and Aaron had introduced us to the dish when we went for noodles in Bangkok: the child of Thai and Indian curry, with yellow egg noodles, chicken, deep fried noodles, and a thick yellow broth, served with lime, red onion, and pickled cabbage. It's heavenly and I think I ate it at least eight times in ten days.</div>

                <div>Really, everything we ate in Thailand was great. Its cuisine is markedly different than Vietnamese or Laotian food, and relies on a lot of fresh chilies, lime, and the secret ingredient: sugar. Peter and I took a cooking class at Baan Thai (thanks for the rec, Fiona!) and were surprised to find cooking Thai food was much easier and faster than we thought it would be. Nothing we cooked took longer than 15 minutes – fried spring rolls, tom yum soup, green curry, khao soi, pad thai, papaya salad, and cashew chicken. It was so much better than any "Thai curry" we'd ever made at home, and the difference was the freshness and quantity of ingredients like Thai ginger (galangal) and chilies. We used to buy small glass jars of curry paste at home, but now we realize it tastes nothing like what's its supposed to. We can't wait to try at home with the small cookbooks they gave us at the end of class.</div>

                <div>One evening, Peter found an activity through emailing Alex, a friend of a guy we had met on the Tour du Mont Blanc hike. Alex lived full time in Chiang Mai and suggested an open mic night. We didn't know this before we went, but it turned out to be entirely expats from America (and one lone rapping Brit). It was pretty cool to see people get up and present their work in various stages of doneness, some stuff ad-libbed, in front of a welcoming audience of creative enthusiasts. Elizabeth Gilbert, author of "Eat Pray Love" and "Big Magic," is big on the idea that the time to put your art out in the world is precisely when you're not yet ready. You'll never actually get ready unless you do, because you'll never receive feedback or practice the performance. The Chiang Mai expat community seems to be full of creative people eager to share and receive works in progress, and it felt open and welcoming.</div>

                <div>A girl named Julie got up and took a seat onstage, explaining that she was going through some medical stuff and was going to do a sit-down heart-to-heart. Despite the hardships she was going through – needing to stop her travels and return to the U.S. because her chronic arthritis, diagnosed at age 22, had gotten so severe – she was full of joy and gratitude. Curiously, she mentioned several times how happy she was to have moved to Thailand and quit drinking, now living a wholesome and healing life, but also talked a lot about getting high (including earlier that day on her way to the hospital). The drug culture is definitely going strong in northern Thailand.</div>

                <div>Next to our guesthouse was Hidden House yoga, advertising twice-daily classes on a handwritten sign. The 90-minute classes were held in a wooden lofted room with space for about fifteen students.  Since I'd started physical therapy right before leaving Saigon, and had been massaging out the area of scar tissue, I decided to try a class and see how my recovering hamstring handled it. It felt SO GOOD to move my body again – my weak, zero-core-strength body – that I went three times, and would have gone more if I wasn't incredibly sore. Peter joined for two of the classes even though he's not a big fan of yoga, and liked it as well – a high compliment.</div>

                <div>We also celebrated an awesome New Year's, very different from every other adult New Year's we'd spent either at home or at Monk's Kettle in San Francisco. Chiang Mai's residents and tourists gather at Tha Phae gate and <a href="https://worldofwander.app/photoPost/chiang-mai-lanterns">buy lanterns to release into the night sky</a>, letting go of any negative events or emotions from the past year at the same time. Both of us were moved by the symbolism behind the tradition and the sight of thousands of lanterns drifting across the city towards the stars. (For those of you worried about the sustainability, the lanterns do not end up polluting water sources! They drift down into fields outside of Chiang Mai, where they are collected, and are biodegradable except for the metal wires.) People were occasionally inexpert (read: incredibly stupid) with them, not letting the air heat up enough, and would launch the not-yet-ready lanterns above their heads only for them to crash into the crowd in a fiery ball. I have a hard time imagining American cities allowing this kind of weaponry at a public celebration, but it's pretty fun.</div>

                <div>One morning, we got up before dawn to hike to the Doi Suthep temple for sunrise. We caught a Grab to the base of the hike and used Peter's phone to light the way through 45 minutes of uphill darkness. But when we got to what we thought was the temple, we realized it was less than halfway to the top and we were going to miss the sun. It would be another 90 minutes of hiking to the top, and neither of us felt like it (plus, it was pouring rain). Not sure what to do, we headed out to the main road to see if Chiang Mai's red truck taxis took passengers up to the temple – and luckily we caught one just a few minutes later. When we finally got to the temple by 8 a.m. we realized it was a huge tourist attraction, but mainly for Thai people – there hadn't been a ton of information in English online on how to get there.</div>

                <div>Another excursion from Chiang Mai was via car: we drove out to Doi Inthanon national park to see some views and waterfalls, and it did not disappoint. The main hike took two hours, was pretty busy with tourists, and required hiring a local guide (done easily at the hike entrance) – but was truly beautiful. The fees for foreigners to enter the park had been as steep as those in California, but we were happy to pay to support the preservation of nature. There aren't a ton of places in Southeast Asia doing that well right now.</div>

                <div>Finally, the second-coolest thing we did after the lantern festival was to visit the "sticky waterfall." Similar to Kuang Si in <a href="https://worldofwander.app/photoPost/luang-prabang">Luang Prabang</a> and a few other falls we saw around the north, there's a mineral in the water that creates a hardened clay-like surface, instead of covering rocks in algae. At the sticky waterfall, the mineral deposits were so non-slimy that you could actually walk straight up it! The pictures we'd seen of it beforehand made it look pretty small, but there are actually four large sections of the falls, and we spent close to two hours exploring and taking photos.</div>
