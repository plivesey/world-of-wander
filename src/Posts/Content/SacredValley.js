                <div>We visited Peru with my (Alice’s) family in April 2018 – yes, that was technically one month before we quit our jobs and left on this adventure, but Peru was too cool not to share here. We only had one week to explore it and to get to and from <a href="/post/planning-machu-picchu">Machu Picchu</a>, but in three days we were able to see some other incredible ruins in Cusco city and the Sacred Valley. We’d love to go back and be able to explore some of the further out spots like <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/peru/choquequirao">Choquequirao</a>, <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/peru/attractions/chan-chan/a/poi-sig/1165434/1327130">Chan Chan</a>, and <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/peru/kuelap">Kuelap</a> – one day!</div>

                <div>The first thing we learned about the Incas is that the term 'Inca civilization’ is a misnomer. The Incas were the rulers of the Quechua civilization, like the Pharaohs were to the Egyptians, and there were only 14 of them spanning a total of 94 years. The last Inca died as the Spanish were conquering Peru, and most of the technological and agricultural advances of the ancient Quechuas were lost.</div>

There are also animals that were important to them: the condor, the puma, and the snake. The Inca ruler, a demi-god, was the sun and his wife was the moon. We saw these symbols at several of the ruins we visited.</div>

In the Cusco earthquakes of 1650 and 1950, the ancient temples were the only structures to survive. The stone pieces are all unique sizes and shapes that are carved to fit together perfectly, but no one knows how they shaped them into these precise shapes. Some even have 10 or 11 sides! They don’t use any kind of cement, and are secured together like legos.</div>

Archaeologists think it may have been built by the Killke culture preceding the Incas, and used as a citadel or fortress. Most of what the Spaniards knew about the place came from the chronicles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Garcilaso_de_la_Vega">Garcilaso de la Vega</a>, who only saw the site when he was six years old. According to our guide, a lot of what we know about the Incas and Quechuas came from him, but since he left Peru at a young age it’s impossible to know how reliable his account is.</div>

'Qenko’ means zigzag, and the walls that were built around the natural rock formations have zigzags hewn in. In one part of the site, you can walk through a semi-underground tunnel where it is believed sacrifices and mummifications took place.</div>

Quechuas believed that bathing in it would purify you, and drinking it would bring you fertility. This small site was nearly empty of tourists and extremely peaceful when we visited.</div>

                <div>For a long time, historians thought Moray was a temple dedicated to Pacha Mama because of its concentric circles that slope downward to the bottom of the crater. But during restoration, they discovered seeds of bizarre fruits and vegetables like avocados, which normally can’t be grown so high in the Andes. They now think it was a testing ground for domesticating seeds to grow in varied climates. There is a whopping 7-degree temperature difference between the bottom and upper terraces, essentially creating a false jungle in the mountains. They also now think the massive divot in the earth, as well as the two smaller divots nearby, were caused by meteorites, which are common in the region.</div>

There are several <a href="https://moon.com/2014/02/three-great-day-hikes-in-ollantaytambo-peru/">day hikes</a> you can do from the town, but since they’re 6-8 hours, we decided not to do them.

Manco Inca then withdrew his forces far into the jungle at Vilcabamba, where the resistance lasted as the Neo-Inca State for forty more years.</div>

You enter through the pedestrian-only cobbled streets of the town, which are also beautiful to explore. However, I’m not sure why the Quechuas decided that halfway up a massive hill was the best place to store bags of grain, especially since they presumably needed to be walked up and down by humans since there are several staircases on the climb.</div>
