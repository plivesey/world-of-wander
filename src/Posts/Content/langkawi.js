                <div>After a whirlwind two weeks in Sri Lanka, we took a red-eye to Kuala Lumpur followed by an early morning flight to Langkawi island, an hour away. We arrived at <a href="https://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/The-Crowded-House/Langkawi/287019">The Crowded House</a> hostel at 10 a.m., when most of the guests were just waking up and coming over to breakfast, and pretty much haven't moved for a week.</div>

                <div>We've hit a point in our travels of planning fatigue. The travel part is still amazing, but needing to figure out what to do while traveling – where to stay, how to get to the next place, where to rent a motorbike and where to go on that motorbike – is overwhelming, and sapping some of the fun out of it. I booked Langkawi for two nights after almost zero research, figuring it couldn't go poorly to be on a beautiful tropical island. The main negative I'd read about it online was that it was too touristy. I now think those people have clearly never been to the Thai islands – just a ferry ride away – because this is by far the chillest place we've been in Southeast Asia.</div>

                <div>Basically, every day we wake up close to ten. (One day, when we wanted to actually get out and see the island, we set an alarm for 9 a.m. and snoozed twice.) In Sri Lanka we had been getting up early almost every morning, but the redeye really threw us off – and we have quickly adopted the schedule of the backpackers at the hostel. After lounging around a bit until nearly noon, we either make the decision to continue lounging into the afternoon, or walk into town for some air conditioned cafe time and a long lunch. In the late afternoon, I sometimes head over to the quiet Pantai Tengah beach to tan, which I can't do in the noon sun because we're too close to the equator. Around 6 p.m. we work out – Peter usually going for the group activities like beach volleyball or ping pong, and me doing 15 minutes of yoga in the room and immediately showering to cool off. More lounge time follows, possibly with beers – happy hour doesn't start until 8 p.m. At 9 we'd head out to one of two places for dinner (<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Restoran+Nasi+Kandar+Tomato/@6.2823283,99.722404,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x304b87dec41a8883:0x193adb71ed9a1505!8m2!3d6.2848127!4d99.7324196">Tomato</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Grill%26chill/@6.2823283,99.722404,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x304b8737e6fc5d73:0x2e560b6b40403e58!8m2!3d6.2772756!4d99.7337151">Grill & Chill</a>), either alone or with a group from the hostel. Stay up until midnight, rinse and repeat.</div>

                <div>It took us 6 days to finally rent a motorbike and go visit the nearest waterfall, Air Terjun, in the north of the island. March is squarely in the dry season, so the waterfall was more of a trickle – but Seven Wells Waterfall next door (up 350 steps) was a very cool spot. It's not actually a waterfall, but a set of seven pools trickling into each other, where you can swim and hang out for hours. We got a tip from a volunteer at the hostel to follow the path at the top of Seven Wells for ten minutes until you reached an eighth, best well. This one was deep enough to jump into from an overhanging rock, and completely secluded. Peter and I hung around for an hour watching massive tadpoles come up for air in the pool and dragonflies glitter in the sun. Definitely an idyllic activity.</div>

                <div>Most nights on this trip, we've stayed in either an Airbnb or a cheap hotel or guesthouse. The Crowded House was a proper backpacker's hostel, with hammocks and floor cushions but no real chairs, a constant whiff of cigarette smoke from the Europeans, and most people opting to spend hours in the common area playing music and chatting rather than in their rooms (this also may have been due to the fact that the wifi did not extend into the rooms).</div>

                <div>The volunteer who had given us the waterfall tip had just started her travels around Southeast Asia, with Langkawi as her first destination – and she'd ended up staying for almost two months. One volunteer couple had been there for a year, and it wasn't their first visit – they had met at the hostel three years ago. Two other women had met and married Malay men, had children, and stayed connected to the hostel. After our first two nights were up, we extended, and extended again. We learned that if you book 7 nights, you get the 8th free, and of course we took that offer. It was so special to find a place with such a strong and welcoming community.</div>

                <div>We only have 4 weeks between Malaysia and Indonesia before our flight back to America, and initially I felt guilty that we weren't bopping around Malaysia more. It's a great country to visit, with everything from volcanoes to tea farms in the high country to incredible snorkeling off gorgeous islands. But, there's no way we'll see the whole of two island countries in four weeks, no matter what we do. We also could have seen <a href="https://www.thecrazytourist.com/25-best-things-to-do-in-langkawi-malaysia/">everything in Langkawi</a>, but for now... I've made peace with nine days of bumming on a beach.</div>
