                <div>2018 has been a truly incredible year for us, and we're so happy we took the leap to spend time exploring the world (especially because that leap was really scary!) On New Year's Eve, we went to Chiang Mai's lantern festival, where thousands of people gather to light up lanterns like hot air balloons and release them into the sky. With the lantern, you release negative things from the last year – expectations, failures, toxicity. Then, you look forward to the new year.</div>

I stayed at the Ritz Carlton Half Moon Bay on a work trip and felt very fancy. We went on our annual ski trip to Montana, which our friend Ben hosts and organizes, and there were some shenanigans involving drinking games and dancing on coffee tables. On the way, we stopped over in Seattle to see Mary and David and discovered Peter's favorite bar, Barnacle (an amaro bar.)</div>

Our highlight was on the day we went to <a href="https://worldofwander.app/post/planning-machu-picchu">Machu Picchu</a>: as we started the Huyana Picchu hike to get a view of the main ruins, we saw a sign for a smaller peak, Huchu'y Picchu, and a path that no one was on. We went to the top and had the views of Machu Picchu all to ourselves. Also, we went to New Orleans for a Sigma Chi wedding, had a blast, and fell in love with the brunch at Cane and Table.</div>

That's a sign of a successful going away party. (No photos exist from this night.) We also went to Rhode Island for Kevin and Ashley's wedding, and took the groom out to a club the night before the big event. On May 29, we took a one-way flight to England.</div>

We then went to our favorite country, <a href="https://worldofwander.app/photoPost/best-photos-iceland">Iceland</a>, for three weeks, and loved living in a camper van. A huge highlight was the end of our first semi-terrible day on the <a href="https://worldofwander.app/post/laugavegur">Laugavegur trek</a>, when made it through a snowstorm and caught the first glimpse of our warm hut. Another was our <a href="https://worldofwander.app/post/hot-pots-of-iceland">hot waterfall</a> adventure day, which included meeting an over-excited husky and getting a lift from a burly man driving a crazy jeep through a river.</div>

We <a href="https://worldofwander.app/post/sailing-england">went sailing</a> with Peter's parents and saw gorgeous sunsets over the Channel. And we hiked 100 miles over 10 days on the <a href="https://worldofwander.app/post/hiking-tour-du-mont-blanc">Tour du Mont Blanc</a>, the highlight of which was eating a massive bowl of spaghetti carbonara at the top of a mountain on day 2.</div>

We stayed with Mary and David again in Seattle and fell in love with the city. We discovered new locations of McMenamins and spent lots of time at the outdoor bars and pools in Seattle, Bend, and Portland – and after a beer festival there, spontaneously went to a Portland Timbers Game with friends of friends of my cousin Katie.</div>

In <a href="https://worldofwander.app/photoPost/hanoi-highlights">Hanoi</a>, we took a terrifying bicycle tour of the city during rush hour and followed it that evening with a redeeming and delicious <a href="https://worldofwander.app/photoPost/hanoi-street-food">street food</a> tour. We took an overnight trip to <a href="https://worldofwander.app/post/ninh-binh">Tam Coc</a> and watched the sunset from Mua Caves. Our favorite part of Cao Bang was not the expected Ban Gioc waterfall, but just motorbiking around the mountains surrounding the city. And when we got to Saigon, we went to a Halloween trivia night with new friends and WON! (Peter and I contributed very little to the actual trivia, but we were the fastest couple to spin your partner into a mummy with toilet paper and take a tequila shot.)</div>

We escaped the city and went to the idyllic Thai islands, where we took in sunset on <a href="https://worldofwander.app/post/koh-yao">Koh Yao Noi</a> from a tiny beachside shack called the Gypsy Bar and survived a rainstorm by hiding out to eat and drink at Rice Terrace Restaurant on Koh Yao Yai.

In <a href="https://worldofwander.app/post/dalat">Dalat</a>, we sat through the rain at a public square to watch Vietnam win the AFF Cup regional finals. Our friends Fiona and Aaron came to Saigon, and we went together to Bangkok, where we had some truly excellent food and drinks and were enchanted by DJ Bear.
