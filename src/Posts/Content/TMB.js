                <div>One of our goals for our year(s) of travel is to spend more time hiking and generally outdoors. So, with minimal backpacking experience, we signed up for a trek which circles an Alp mountain range and takes 8-12 days. Sounds reasonable, right? We bought new backpacks, practiced in June with a couple of shorter treks in <a href="/posts/uk/lake-district/">England</a>, and <a href="/posts/iceland/laugavegur/">Iceland</a>, and planned for a week of relaxing in the South of France afterward.</div>

                <div>There were literal highs and lows on this trip — every day seemed to take us up and over a mountain, then back down to a village for the night — as well as emotional highs and lows. I’ve given each day a grade, which is not grading the quality of the hike that day so much as our performance as travelers taking on what the day threw at us. Quick note - I make a few references to Kev Reynolds’s “Trekking the Tour of Mont Blanc” book, which is essential.</div>

                <div>The aspect of the Tour du Mont Blanc that makes it so charming — passing through small Alp towns — can also make navigation difficult. The path is occasionally poorly marked, intersects frequently with biking trails and offshoot paths, and key turns in and out of villages are not always signposted. Mission number one in Les Houches was to find the start of the trail, and we were not fantastic at it. We walked a couple of kilometers up and down the road before even starting the main trek, and then unfortunately got lost several more times that day. Since we had started late and it was close to 90 degrees, day 1 was pretty tough.</div>

At dinner, Carol and Jean ordered a quarter liter of wine but were given a half liter, and didn’t finish it.

If you are concerned about protein, bring your own protein bars! We had to adapt to large sugary breakfasts, and by day 4, I was already looking forward to eggs and peanut butter.</div>

However, we both had nagging pains — Peter’s heels and toes were raw from his boots, and my right Achilles tendon and left knee were inflamed.

Self-organizing had been difficult — the TMB goes through three countries and there’s no main governing board. One site listed all the refuges with contact information, but many didn’t have online reservations and the phone numbers didn’t always go through. You’d plot out your route only to find that the lodging for half of the days was unavailable. And it might have been possible without speaking French, but much more difficult. It does cost a lot more to have someone book for you, but if you are able to pay for it I’d recommend doing that.</div>

                <div>KR’s book has several suggestions of alternative routes, usually with better views, but often longer or steeper. On day 10 we accidentally took one of them which was “in some ways, a better and more varied route than the traditional stage […] although it’s more strenuous than first appears.” Oops.</div>

                <div>Though the route was a bit longer than the main trail, it was a nice walk alternating through wildflower fields, wooded hillsides, and a couple of snow crossings. We reached the altitude equivalent to the day’s main peak, Col de Balme, early in the hike. We sat there eating our picnic, looking out at the Chamonix valley and an impressive mountain range, including our best view yet of Mont Blanc.</div>

                <div>Though we’d gotten stronger during the trip, our bodies were starting to give out by the last day. We started at the La Boerne refuge and had originally planned to walk the detour to Lac Blanc, an alpine lake. But the initial hill was so exhausting that we scrapped our plans and headed straight to the cable car, skipping the last major downhill into Courmayeur as well. Since all the hills are so steep, the downhill is often as difficult as going up. </div>

                <div>As we crested the hill and saw the ski lodge where we knew we could get lunch, I was tired but thrilled we’d finished. In total we had walked a bit less than 100 miles. Peter says he prefers 4-5 day long treks, but I’d be interested in tackling longer ones like the Camino in Spain or treks in Patagonia. I guess we’ll find out!</div>
