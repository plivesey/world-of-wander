                <div>Iceland is a magical place. The majority of Icelanders believe the country is populated by <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/10/why-so-many-icelanders-still-believe-in-invisible-elves/280783/">huldufólk</a>, invisible elves. The land is unlike any other, a treeless moonscape with electric green moss-covered lava outflows and ice blue rivers ribboned across black gravel. Geothermal energy powers the island, bubbling underneath the surface and breaking free at thousands of tiny hot spring fissures. We've been obsessed since first going in 2013, and spent three weeks there at the beginning of this trip exploring more of the island.</div>

                <div>One of our favorite activities is seeking out and soaking in hot springs, also known as hot pots. Some have been enclosed and turned into swimming pools or spas. Many others are located in someone's field or next to a tiny stream on a mountain. We're listing the ones we've been to here, but there are tons of others, many of which are less explored by tourists and hard to find. One tip is to visit local tourist offices in small towns as you drive around. They'll be very knowledgeable about activities in the area and any local hot springs. And if you're <a href='https://www.rent.is/blog/driving-the-highlands-in-iceland/'>driving off the Ring Road into the highlands</a>, you should have a 4x4 vehicle that is approved to go on the highland roads (these cost more to rent, but open up way more possibilities) and check the <a href='http://www.road.is/travel-info/road-conditions-and-weather/entire-iceland-road-conditions-map/'>road conditions</a>, which can be bad any time of year.

                <div>There are also tons of swimming pools, all powered by geothermal energy, all over Iceland. Swimming is a required activity in high schools, and in most towns you can find a pool. Take one or two swim suits and get in your daily exercise or soak. Bonus: If you're sleeping in a camper van, you can shower there, included in the low pool fees (usually $5-10.)

                <div>Tourism has completely exploded in Iceland in the past few years. When we went five years ago, the government had just started their program of subsidizing flights to increase tourism. It worked better than expected. Back then, I could only find one blog post talking about Seljavallalaug and how to get there. Now, it's on Google Maps (along with all the other "hidden" things in Iceland) and there are so many people visiting, the farm owners have put up signs begging people to stop knocking on their door asking for directions. But this gem is one of my favorite things we've been to from both trips. You bathe at the foot of the famous Eyjafjallajökull volcano which famously erupted in 2010. The pool is fed at one end by the Seljavellir geothermal spring but the other end can be chilly. It feels forgotten and secluded.

                <div>It's also still off the literal beaten path. To reach Seljavallalaug, which is just west of Skogafoss on the Ring Road, you turn in on the 242 and continue straight to park past the farm. Then you have a pretty long walk along a gravel pathway beside a river (with one possible river crossing, depending on the time of year.) Just keep going in the direction of the river/glacier until you see the pool.

The swamp-like river that winds past camp is situated across some of these hot springs, so parts of the river are wonderfully warm to hang out in (though you might need to wade through a bit of cold river to get there!) If you've seen pictures of people sitting in a steaming river, it was most likely here.

There are also a ton of short hikes you can do in the area and we'd highly recommend it – it's some of the most beautiful landscapes you'll see in Iceland, which is saying a lot.

                <div>We visited this hot pot back in 2013 as part of a guided tour of the Snæfellsnes peninsula. At that time, our tour guide seemed a bit crazy as he drove the van around a deserted swampy area, walked around, and finally gestured for us to follow him – revealing a tiny, crystal clear, rock-rimmed pool surrounded by nothing but mist and mountains. We crammed in cozily with the rest of the tour group and shared a few beers. After the trip, we had a photo of the spot printed on canvas and hung it up in our apartment; it's one of Peter's favorite things.

You are definitely supposed to have a 4x4 to go on the road to get there, and I wish we had, but we met a ranger/tourist information officer at the nearby dam who said our camper van would be fine on the roads. We have a different definition of "fine." The road started out gravelly but OK going about 20 mph, and quickly devolved into a boulder field. We eventually parked the van and walked the rest of the way. There's a pretty deep river crossing just before the waterfall that you definitely can't do without a vehicle that looks like it belongs at a monster truck rally.

The junction just after the dam bridge is where we stopped and consulted a map, and met the information officer who was very helpful. South just a little bit on the 933, the 910 winds away to the west. You stay on it until it basically dead ends at the river (or, cross the river in your 4x4.

It's the perfect temperature, and we soaked for half an hour or so while chatting to some Canadians who had found it through a GoPro video. It was definitely an adventure and a search to find it! Fosslaug is located on a river just above a great waterfall (Reykjafoss), but there are no signs for the roads leading to it or the path to walk there. From Varmahlið, drive south along the 752 and take a right on the 753. Pass Sauerbær farm on the left, cross the river, then take two rights when the road forks. If you look at the map, you're trying to stay close to the river. Drive a few hundred yards until you come to a fence gate with a sign on it asking you not to drive any further. Walk through the gate along the path until you get to a wooden footbridge; cross it onto the island. Walk to the other side going either directly straight across the top or around the left side. To get to a great view of the waterfall, just follow the river flow. Most likely, you'll have this spot all to yourself.

It has a nice view of Vatnsfjörður fjord leading out to the ocean, and you can pair it with going to the local swimming pool in Flókalundur (well sign-posted.) One note: the hot pot is not where Google Maps says it is. It's up the road about 500m north of Flókalundur on the 60. You can't see it easily from the road and we missed the sign the first time, but pull over the first spot you can on the right after you drive north past the hotel/campground.
