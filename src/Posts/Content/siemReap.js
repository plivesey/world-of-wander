                <div>The Siem Reap airport is not the smallest airport I've been to – that distinction goes to Kalispell in Montana – but it's the most hotel lobby-like airport experience I've ever had. The place is brand new. As your plane lands on the tiny tarmac and you walk in to collect your bags, you pass by sculpted gardens, clean white stucco walls, and not a single orange cone or beeping truck. Inside it's airy, clean, modern, and only inhabited at any given time by the passengers of one flight coming in and 1-2 flights departing (almost entirely foreigners). The airport did exist before the huge boom in tourism that Siem Reap has seen in the last 10 years, but they just redid the place last year. </div>

                <div>We were visiting Siem Reap for three days with our family: my mom and little sister, and Peter's parents, who had all flown into Saigon a few days earlier. We all existed the airport that first afternoon feeling the most blissful an airport has ever made anyone feel, ready for our first ride out to the temples that evening.</div>

                <div>After a brief stop at our hotel to drop off bags and take advantage of their 2-for-1 beers, we met our tuk-tuk driver, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/meas.globalteer">Meas</a>. My chiropractor in Saigon had recommended him, and Meas and I had been texting through FB Messenger (nearly all businesses around Vietnam run on it, too). He and his brother each took 3 of us in a tuk-tuk and we drove off to buy tickets. To enter the temple at Angkor Wat, you buy a ticket for Angkor Archaeological Park, which covers over 400 square kilometers and many, many more temples. The options for passes are 1 day at $37 or 3 days at $62 – definitely higher than other prices in Southeast Asia, but very much worth it, and it funds restoration as well as facilities for the 2.5 million annual visitors.</div>

                <div>When we arrived at the parking lot, there was a barrier blocking cars, tuk-tuks, and even bicycles from getting closer. As we approached the main (western) gate, it became clear why: Angkor Wat is surrounded by a moat, and with the original stone bridge under restoration, the only way in was over a temporary floating bridge made of plastic cubes tied together. The walk across the moat and up to the gate was quite long, and once we got through the gate, we saw the main temple off in the distance with a massive courtyard and very long walkway to get there. When it was built originally, the courtyard housed the king in a wooden palace, but now it's just a vast grassy expanse.</div>

I didn't realize before going that the Khmer people were mostly Hindu at the time, the 1100s. The temple is dedicated to Vishnu, Brahma, and Shiva.</div>

The temple had fallen down in many places due to time and weather, but Angkor Wat was sadly further damaged during the Cambodia Civil War under the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.</div>

                <div>My favorite tidbit about Angkor Wat was learning why the stairs up to the central sanctuary are so steep: the king used to arrive via elephant through a back entrance and sit at the top, and his people had to climb up hunched over and practically bowing up the stairs to pay their respects. The moment of the sun actually setting wasn't hugely impressive – the sky had a reddish, dusty haze – but the golden light throughout the hour leading up to it was absolutely beautiful.</div>

                <div>When researching what to do in Siem Reap beyond temples, Peter found an article in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/26/travel/what-to-do-in-36-hours-in-siem-reap-cambodia.html">New York Times</a> which we couldn't decide was ironic or not. In addition to suggesting a mini-golf course with replicas of the temples, it recommended a night at Phare Circus – so Peter signed us up. I am very skeptical of both circuses and theater productions (this was a mix) and probably wouldn't have booked it if we didn't have family coming, but it turned out to be fun and memorable.</div>

After winding through the trees, we emerged onto a rocky path following the moat and headed north to Angkor Thom, where our guide told us we'd be biking along the top of the old walls. Peter's mom Hilary nearly refused because of the height, but once we were up there, it was actually a wide (sandy, rocky) path that gently sloped down on one side rather than a steep drop.</div>

We followed it up with sraa-infused jams; we loved the tomato chili, but couldn't justify buying a jar with only a few weeks left in the apartment and how little we've actually been cooking.
