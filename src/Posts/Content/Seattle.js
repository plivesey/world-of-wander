                <div>I'd always assumed Seattle was fairly similar to Portland (where I'm from) – just larger and colder, both in temperature and temperament. But I totally underestimated how cool it is that the city and surrounding areas are peninsulas and islands surrounded by the Puget Sound with many inlets and lakes. A lot of people commute by ferry, and some of the major neighborhoods like Westlake are defined by their relation to the water.</div>

The park is about three hours including a ferry ride from the city, and when we told people in Seattle we'd just spent a week camping there, it was surprising how many of them had never made the trip out.</div>

It's truly huge and we barely scratched the surface; it would take years to get to all the spots on the ‘best of' hiking lists. Instead, here's a mini photo-journal of our two weeks in Washington.</div>

Only two campgrounds in Olympic National Park take reservations, and the rest are first come first serve. We arrived on a Monday at 1 p.m. and got the third-to-last spot. Go early in the morning and scope out people who are packing up to leave if you want to guarantee; if you can't find any spots at your top campground, Heart O' The Hills Campground is massive and will likely have a spot open."

The vampires chose it because it had the least amount of sun out of any city in the U.S. (they could have gone somewhere like Greenland but you know… no one said that book made any sense.) At least the week we were there, the weather proved Stephanie Meyer wrong.'
