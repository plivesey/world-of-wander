                <div>Peter and I knew almost nothing about Malaysia before we landed there in March. My prior knowledge was mostly limited to the airport, which is one of the biggest hubs in Southeast Asia; our flights to Nepal and Sri Lanka from Vietnam had both connected through KL (Kuala Lumpur). We were at a point in our travels, several months into Southeast Asia, where we had ceased to research or plan anything before going somewhere - it took too much time and energy day-to-day to decide on and execute a plan, and we had little energy left for future trip research.</div>

This is by no means a thorough or even terribly knowledgeable piece on the country – it's just our experiences being wonderfully surprised by a beautiful and modern country.</div>

I obviously can't speak for all Americans, but when I mentioned we were going to people back home, not one person had been and no one knew anything about it except to ask, "Is that a Muslim country?" It doesn't get a bad rap, it gets almost NO rap.</div>

When we were in the Thai islands, you'd best hold on tight to the motorbike and except roads in various states of construction or dilapidation. On Langkawi, a tiny island just south of those Thai islands, we never met a road that didn't look brand new. I couldn't believe how good the highways were in Kuala Lumpur.</div>

We didn't need any taxis in Kuala Lumpur, because their metro system is so expansive, efficient, and cheap – on top of being the cleanest and most modern I've seen outside of Tokyo. Only once did we actually take a Grab, which was when we arrived at the station for the Batu Caves-bound train moments after it departed and learned they only run once an hour.</div>

KL feels like it's ahead of most or possibly all U.S. cities in infrastructure. In reality it's probably just that the metro system is way better and the buildings generally more modern – WEF gives the U.S. and Malaysia similar scores on infrastructure. The investment in Malaysia is definitely concentrated in a few cities, leaving large parts of the country worse off and bringing the average down. However, I did find research showing the U.S. is one of the most overrated countries for infrastructure (see <a href="http://giia.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Global-Infrastructure-Index-2018-_Global_V3_embargo-00.01-GMT-29-Nov-2018.pdf">page 12 of this report</a>.)</div>

In order to marry, they had had to convert to Islam (on paper only – neither practiced it). But it was obvious after we left Langkawi that not everyone in the country was Muslim. It seems that Malays need to be Muslim – or to phrase it differently, non-Muslim Malays are not considered Malay. Nationwide, a little over 60% of the population is Muslim and the rest are Buddhist, Hindu, and other religions.</div>

It was a very different feel for me than Dubai, the only part of the Middle East I've visited, where alcohol is limited mainly to tourist venues, conservative clothing is expected, and the call to prayer was audible multiple times a day. Still, we tended to cover up more out of respect for the local culture – tourists may not need to wear head coverings in Malay areas, but I don't think you should walk around the tourist strip in your bikini or spaghetti strap top, either.</div>

Batu Caves, with its famous rainbow-colored steps, is just 25 minutes from downtown Kuala Lumpur.

                <ul>
                     <li><b>Art Lane</b>: What a cool concept. Anyone can apply to paint a piece on a bit of wall in this converted old building. Like many of the old Chinese-style buildings, it's long and thin  with rooms following each other, like a shotgun-style house. You can walk in from either Beach Street or Lebuh Victoria and pop out on the other street. It's free, and you can spend a lot of time looking at the wonderful unique pieces from artists of all levels and reading their accompanying pieces.</li>
                     <li><b>Hin Bus Depot</b>: Awesome public space made over from a converted bus station to house public art and events. It's rimmed with little shops including Wholey Wonder Vegan Cafe and Yoga, where we took an extremely sweaty yoga class, and a kombucha stand for much-needed refreshment afterward.</li>
                     <li><b>Public Street Art</b>: Get a map or look up a list of the murals and steel-rod sculptures online; there are so many! Lebuh Armenian is one famous street for it; my favorite pieces were Love Me Like Your Fortune Cat, Brother & Sister on a Swing, and a strip on Lebuh Acheh.</li>
                     <li><b>Lover's Lane</b>: Super touristy, but also cute and has some great bars. I preferred going in the daytime and starting from the north end, walking from the direction of the Eastern & Oriental Hotel and The Blue Mansion. So many cute spots in the original Chinese-structure houses, including stores built out of family craft-making workshops. At night the restaurant hawkers are a bit intense but it's still nice; try Junk Cafe just around the corner on Chulia Street for a great margarita slightly away from the tourist rush. (And when I say tourist rush, this is NOTHING compared to most cities in Asia. Literally just a few hawkers and slightly elevated prices.)</li>
                     <li><b>Tek Sen Restaurant</b>: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tek+Sen+Restaurant/@5.4146928,100.3367554,17.15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x304ac391a9753e73:0xeb4a3550c86316ea!8m2!3d5.4174153!4d100.3359742">This</a> was recommended by the woman who sold me kombucha as her favorite spot in the city, which she'd been visiting for 20 years. She warned us to get there early because they end service at 8:30; we got there at 7:30 and missed the boat for a table. There were a large number of people being turned away and I wish we'd been able to go. Get there early!! A delicious alternative where you can try teow chew Chinese food is <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chao+Xuan+Restaurant/@5.4161512,100.3338491,16.72z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x304ac3c94f352817:0xd7700d4e0c8450b2!8m2!3d5.4143445!4d100.3345084">Chao Xuan</a>.</li>
                     <li><b>Walk the whole Old Town</b>: We didn't pay any museum or historic building entrance fees while there, and I don't think you need to to experience the beauty and culture of this place. Every street of Old Town has something special to see, and there's so much free street art and beautiful historic building exteriors.</li>

                <ul>
                     <li><b>KL Forest Eco Park</b>: This piece of jungle forest remained undeveloped, and now has trails and educational centers and plaques throughout it. The coolest part is a series of canopy walks through the trees, and you also get a cool view of KL Tower surrounded by jungle.</li>
                     <li><b>Botanical Gardens</b>: Large, extremely well-kept, and beautiful. Sunset was perfect, as we got to watch it set across the lake. Early morning would be perfect for a run there!</li>
                     <li><b>Jalan Alor for street food & street art</b>: Fascinating area to explore and eat to your heart's desire! The night market for street food is <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Alor+Street+Food+Night+Market/@3.1444182,101.7080267,17.35z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x31cc362991b8c947:0xf3d7d3a568d2c28e!8m2!3d3.1455725!4d101.7085236">here</a>, and the coolest street art we saw was <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jalan+Alor+Street+Art+1/@3.1470462,101.7076514,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x31cc37e8fd86efcb:0xe3e9fc3f4ab7dbea!8m2!3d3.1470462!4d101.7093645">here</a>.</li>
                     <li><b>Batu Caves</b>: Rainbow stairs to a Hindu temple inside a cave. Worth the hype. Opens at 7 or 7:30 a.m. so you can get there early to beat the crowds and heat. We went later in the morning and it was still in shade, and I don't think the crowds detracted from it at all. Make sure to cover knees and shoulders or you'll need to rent a covering at the entrance.</li>
                     <li><b>Chinatown</b>: We stayed here, right next to Pasar Seni station, and it was both a central location and a small neighborhood to easily explore. Jalan Petaling is a cool street market, Bunn Choon has delicious egg tarts (similar to Portuguese egg custards), and the best was PS150 - the speakeasy-style cocktail bar I raved about above.</li>
                     <li><b>The Countdown Clock</b>: Ok, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Countdown+Clock+(CDC)/@3.1498488,101.6936833,18.84z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xa9c4e941ea2861fa!8m2!3d3.1507681!4d101.6943311">this</a> was slightly underwhelming in person… but still a cool installation and free! It's a fountain with a curtain of water, which parts as you walk through and takes a photo of you that gets added to the digital installation at the center. At night it gets lit up in different colors, and I'd recommend visiting then. Bonus: across the street from Merdeka Square on Jalan Raja are some truly gorgeous Arabic-style buildings like this <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sultan+Abdul+Samad+Building/@3.1480535,101.693983,18.84z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x31cc49cd9b918dfd:0xdf3986fb55b00628!8m2!3d3.1486845!4d101.6944038">one</a>.</li>
                     <li><b>Petronas Towers</b>: Stunning viewed from below or a nearby hotel. I did a lot of research into the best place to get a sunset view (<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/DEEP+BLUE+(Rooftop+Bar)/@3.1555443,101.6992931,16.19z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x31cc482906e3b6cb:0x7f77075be6c657ad!8m2!3d3.1583473!4d101.7037922">this was it</a>), but alas the sky was raincloud-y and not worth the overpriced drinks at the rooftop bar, so we skipped and just went to the base for sunset. It was still awesome, and fun to hang out at the fountains both in front of and behind the building. And I think we got a cooler photo than we would have from the rooftop!</li>
