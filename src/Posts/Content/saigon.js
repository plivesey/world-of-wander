                <div>Saigon has been our home base for a short four months, and I find it hard to sum up my feelings on a city in that short a time. For the first month we were here, November, we barely traveled and I spent 2-3 hours every other day getting poked and prodded at the doctor's office to heal my sciatica and hamstring injury. I could barely walk around the city and was in a terrible mood. This of course had a big effect on how I viewed the city, and I started off not enjoying it.</div>

                <div>Of course, that's not fair to Saigon. For as many faults as it has (chief among them for me being pollution, lack of green/water space, and dearth of historic/cute architecture) it's also a thriving, exciting place to live. It's not beautiful, and it's  chaotic and has the craziest motorbike driving we've seen across Asia. But I have loved exploring cafes, bars, shops, and restaurants tucked into alleys or built in old converted apartment buildings. And culturally it's more modern and less conservative than other parts of Asia as well – for instance, tons of girls are college educated, date freely and have tattoos – so it's an easy place for Westerners to call home and integrate into society.</div>

                <div>One of my favorite things about the city was how welcoming people are. We made amazing friends here that we'll stay in touch with for a long time. Some of them were friends-of-friends-of-friends, and some were made through Facebook. I never truly appreciated Facebook for its ability to foster new connections before we got here, but young people in Saigon use it to its full potential. There are several groups for locals and expats where people frequently post things like "I'm new to Saigon! Anyone want to hangout?" or "I'm thinking of offering a night for girls to practice public speaking... anyone interested?" and dozens of people respond. Peter found game nights, chess partners, and soccer teams through it; I found a whole community called the "Fexpats," went to several meetups with Vietnamese and Western girls, and started a book club.</div>

And I'm ashamed that I haven't written any posts about Saigon yet. So, here's a list of our favorite spots, which does double duty as a guide for future travelers and a sort-of love letter to the best of this city. For most of these I provide a Google Maps link.

If you ask they'll let you hold the shell-less crabs from the tanks at the front. Make sure you go to the one that's actually at number 94; a competitor has made a fake Quan Cu 94 at number 86.

My go-to suggestion for meeting up with friends because it has Vietnamese happy hour prices from 5-7 pm (20K for Saigon Special, 70K for wine!) with Western decór and a view over Nguyen Hue walking street. A little hard to find the entrance – as with a lot of spots in Saigon, walk to the street number and look for a tiny sign pointing you to a staircase.</div>

It's the black door right when you get to the top of the first set of stairs. Bonus: before you go up, walk another 20 feet down the alley and turn right to the tiny cute shop selling stationery and gifts. My two favorite dogs in Saigon live here and will give you lots of kisses. Their names are Brown (the husky) and Yellow (the golden retriever) in Vietnamese.</div>
