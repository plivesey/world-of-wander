                <div>Before we quit our jobs and gave up our apartment, we loved California. It has so many opportunities to get outside and hike, swim, kayak, ski, and more. But with jobs in the busy tech industry, we spent too many weekends “recuperating” with Netflix and too many hours hunched over desks. We consistently spent all of our limited American vacation time traveling abroad and were able to make it to places including Japan, Norway, Montenegro, Iceland, and Nicaragua in between trips to see Peter’s family in the U.K. While we were immensely privileged to be able to travel that much, we always wanted to see more and experience the world differently than we could on these short trips.</div>
