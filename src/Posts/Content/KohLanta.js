                <div>We tend to go light on trip planning. It's one of the benefits of long-term travel – we aren't rushing through 10 cities in 14 days or trying to see a whole country in a week, so we aren't forced to plan far in advance. While there have been a couple of times that we missed something by not doing enough research beforehand, it's been nice to be relaxed and flexible.</div>

                <div>I'd done a bit of research before we bought tickets to Thailand to determine which islands to stay on and get loding (since most visitors were on one or two week vacations, everything booked up further in advance.) Koh Lanta had been recommended by one of Peter’s friends, so we booked two nights there. The trip from <a href="https://worldofwander.app/post/koh-yao">Koh Yao Noi</a> ended up taking one longtail boat, a long taxi, and a longer van ride, totalling about 6 hours – when we'd thought it would be 2. So when we finally got into our bungalow and found they had happy hour right then, we decided to stay there for the evening.</div>

                <div>The next morning, I woke up early to see the sunrise from the beach, then grabbed one of the guidebooks from the common area. In addition to beaches, snorkeling, diving, and a thriving party scene, Koh Lanta has a rugged, hilly interior with a few caves and a waterfall. We rented a scooter from the front desk and, after several confused minutes consulting multiple maps to figure out where everything was, headed out to Khao Mai Khew Cave.</div>

                <div>We were joined on the cave tour by a Swiss German couple, an Italian couple, and an Israeli traveler. Only the Israeli had brought the proper footwear; we thought that this cave would be similar to the ones we'd visited in Vietnam, where you can walk upright and easily through most of the cave and there's little danger of slipping. Not so here!</div>

                <div>First, we had a thirty minute hike up through the jungle, in full humidity and 95 degree heat. Then our guide handed out headlamps, and disappeared into a small crack in the hillside. It was clear why the park mandated a guide; the cave was huge, winding, and had a few entrances and exits. It felt very Tolkien-y, like a dragon could have been sleeping in one of the massive chambers.</div>

                <div>Unfortunately, instead of dragons, we encountered the largest spiders I've ever seen. They were larger than tarantulas, though thin and not hairy – about the size of a large man's hand fully outstretched. Our guide pointed out the first one when I was in the back of the group, so I was able to skirt about 30 feet away from it and avoided looking too closely. I am very, VERY scared of spiders.</div>

                <div>Please try to imagine my state of mind when we saw the next one: as we squeezed through a two-foot-wide passage with a chest-height ledge on the left, our guide (who was about 5 people ahead of me) pointed out something on the left, and people kept moving. I turned my headlamp to look and saw a spider about 2 feet away from me, and fully panicked. Luckily, it was just a dead one – still awful, but not an imminent threat. And then, five feet ahead, they found one in a crevice on the right that we needed to squeeze through. I lost it, started hyperventilating, and backed into the people behind me. I was fully prepared to trek an hour back through the cave rather than knowingly get that close to one. Peter said he would stand next to it so I could squeeze through but I refused. This whole time, the guide was assuring us that these were "friendly" spiders and wouldn't touch us. When he saw that I was not having it, he came back down and pushed it away with his hand (!). I scuttled past as quickly as possible but was shaking a bit the rest of the cave. I'm pretty sure it set me back about 3 years of overcoming my arachnophobia.</div>

                <div>Spiders aside, it was a really cool cave and definitely an adventure clambering through it. We were very dirty and sweaty when we finally made it back to the park entrance, and while we waited for lunch, tried to wash off with a hose. We had planned to visit Tiger Cave after Khao Mai Khew, but since it had taken almost three and a half hours including lunch, we drove straight to the waterfall.</div>

                <div>Khlong Chak Waterfall is at the southern end of the island, half an hour's hike along a pretty creekbed. It was a bit more challenging than we'd thought (at least, in our crappy flip flops) and we were surprised and impressed to see several people with babies and toddlers. Khlong Chak is best during the rainy season (over the summer) because it creates a decent amount of flow. We were in the beginning of the dry season, so there was still a trickle but not huge. Still, the setting was beautiful, and it was well worth the short hike.</div>

                <div>The guy who rented me the motorbike said that on the way back up the coastal road, we should stop when we saw a bunch of motorbikes parked in a row because there was a great beach spot. We would have missed the wooden signs otherwise, and I'm so glad we didn't – Nui Beach was a beautiful inlet with a cute tiki bar and plenty of hammocks for me to lie in while Peter played volleyball.</div>

                <div>Before it got dark, we drove back up to our bungalow. The roads were pretty bad in Koh Lanta, though it seemed partially because some were under construction to be repaved, and we didn't want to risk it (you're welcome, Mom.) As soon as we got back, it was time for another happy hour mojito. Lanta A&J, you make truly excellent mojitos.</div>

                <div>If we'd had another day, I would have added on Tiger Cave and possibly Emerald Cave (though for that one, you have to swim through a dark cave to emerge into a beautiful lagoon. After the Thai boys cave emergency, we weren't terribly keen on that.) Koh Lanta's beachfront was great, and extended for miles down the western (sunset) coast. It was a lot more developed than <a href="https://worldofwander.app/post/koh-yao">Koh Yao Yai and Koh Yao Noi</a>, but the gap between the rich tourists staying at resorts and the locals living on the side of the road seemed a lot wider. While I can't say it made the list of places I love and would return to, we had an awesome day of adventures.</div>
