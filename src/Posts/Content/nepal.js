                <div>When Peter and I have made decisions on where to travel to next within Asia, we've been trying to keep our budget in mind (a goal of $100/day for two people, which we mostly blew through this year... oops). However, there are some trips that we've decided are worth it because of how difficult they would be to take as vacations in a future life. Sri Lanka, where I'm writing this from, is one such place – it's as close as you can get to the point on the globe that is the exact opposite from Portland, OR. And Nepal is another.</div>

                <div>To get to the start of our trek in Nepal, we flew from Saigon to Kathmandu via an overnight layover in Kuala Lumpur, and took an eight-hour bus the next day to Pokhara. From Pokhara, it's another 3-4 hours by jeep to Ghandruk, the town where most Annapurna circuit trekkers start. If you had to add on travel from the other side of the world, plus maybe allot time to get over jet lag before starting your hike, it's pretty difficult to fit a Nepal trek into a week.</div>

                <div>And so, when the opportunity presented itself to travel to Nepal from Vietnam, we decided to screw the bank account and go. Our friends Greg, Anna, Brandon, and Thao had booked it as their annual Tet (Chinese New Year) vacation, and said we were welcome to join – despite having only met us a month or so before. Thank you, friends!</div>

                <div>Anna was chief planner and had booked us a guided trek through <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293891-d5998822-Reviews-Happy_Treks_Nepal_Day_Tours-Pokhara_Gandaki_Zone_Western_Region.html">Happy Treks</a>, run by the cheerful Mr. Happy. I'm happy we had a guide for many reasons. One is that when we got to Pokhara ready to start hiking the next day, Mr. Happy had some insight into the weather that we didn't. He rearranged our trip to start a day late and traverse the Poon Hill loop in the opposite direction as originally planned. Turns out, this February had the most snow of the last 11 years, and the reverse in direction meant our longest days in the most snow-covered areas were primarily flat and downhill. It would have been extremely difficult to go with the original plan – which we couldn't have known.</div>

                <div>On our first day of trekking, we were given the option of riding in the jeep as far as it could go and then hiking one and a half hours, or getting out early and adding an hour to the beginning of the hike. As typical type A achievers, and with me feeling carsick in the jeep, Peter and I decided to add on the additional hiking time with our guide, Ram. The early part of the hike was mostly staircase shortcuts bisecting the road's switchbacks. We passed through tiny, steep rice paddies with oxen dragging tills and were surprised when we saw the first bits of snow on the ground and the air suddenly got cold. At our guesthouse in Ghandruk we met up with the rest of the crew, and Ram took us on a tour of the town.</div>

                <div>The next morning, we woke to what is probably the most glorious sunrise I've ever seen. The next two sunrises on the trip would be objectively more scenic as we got closer to the mountains, but the novelty and stark beauty were truly something to behold that first day. We spent nearly an hour watching the pink creep along the top ridge of the mountain and the sun slowly start to illuminate the nearby hills.</div>

                <div>Day two of hiking got us to Tadapani in time for a late lunch. We spent most of the morning walking through snowy forests as a loose pack and stopping frequently for snacks and to rest. It's really nice to hike at a measured pace with breaks – we're more used to pushing until you get to the end point, like on Tour du Mont Blanc where we had to start early and try to beat the heat each day. After lunch, we lounged around playing card games in the teahouse. I can't remember who came up with the rule that the loser of each round had to eat a spoonful of questionable hot sauce, but it definitely added some competition to the games.</div>

                <div>Unfortunately, even though we were only at 2700 meters and Ram said altitude sickness usually starts at 3000, I got it early. After we had started a fire in the teahouse and were huddled around it for warmth, I started feeling really nauseous and headachy and stood outside for a while. I thought it was a short thing that had passed until I went back in during dinner, and had to turn around in two seconds after smelling the food and feeling a fresh surge of nausea. It got worse (I'll spare details), especially when we had to ascend for a few hours on the third day of hiking before we could descend to Gorepani, our stop for the night. I probably haven't used the term 'boot and rally' since college, but that's absolutely the attitude needed to get through an icy hike when you're stopping every once in a while to vomit.</div>

                <div>Ram was a star and held up the rear of our crew, while Anna and I struggled along and exchanged glances of hating life every five minutes or so, and sat down in the snow at least every fifteen. It took us eight hours to do a hike that should have been about four and a half. When we got to the peak of our circuit before heading down to Gorepani, I sat down on a bench and promptly fell asleep while everyone else took pictures and jumped into the snowbanks. On our glorious final descent of the day, we took as many opportunities as possible to slide down the track on our butts (no sled required – just velocity and snow pants). Then I passed out at 6 p.m., still unable to eat anything.</div>

                <div>Peter relayed a funny and odd conversation he had with some of the porters downstairs that evening – they asked him where he was from, married or not, married how long, any kids? When he responded "maybe soon" on the kids (the best response to that question from people you don't know well but who pry about your state of marriage and parenthood), they burst out laughing. He finally got one of them to explain why, though the explanation was a bit garbled and confusing – apparently sex is a pretty taboo subject in Nepal, so by accidentally alluding to it, Peter had made everyone uncomfortable "and very sad." Oddly, now that the subject had been broached, they started pointing at Peter's crotch and making jokes in Nepalese, and then one of them insisted on giving him a foot and calf massage. I don't have any illuminating commentary on that part.</div>

                <div>When the morning of the fourth day arrived, it was time to actually go up to Poon Hill for the famous view. However, with Anna and Thao pretty wiped out, and me definitely unable to hike uphill, only Peter, Greg, and Brandon planned to get up extremely early and make it for sunrise. And then... Greg and Brandon also decided sleep looked like a better option, and only one out of our group of six Poon Hill trekkers actually went to Poon Hill. Honestly though, the views of the mountains were incredible throughout the entire hike, and I'm not hugely bummed I didn't go, especially since Peter took awesome photos from the top for me to vicariously share online (look at the cover image for this post!).</div>

                <div>In addition to the altitude sickness, we hadn't anticipated how dry the air would be (making it hard to stay hydrated, and chapping our faces); how non-restful the guesthouses would be (unheated, mostly without electricity, and with highly questionable toilets); and how 7 kilometers walking on icy rocks in crampons that start falling apart the moment you begin using them is very much not the same as 7 kilometers on a summer hiking trail. We had thought the Poon Hill trek would be pretty easy, and if Peter and I were planning the trip to Nepal for ourselves, we probably would have listened to everyone who says it's for beginners and gone for a harder, longer trek. I'm so glad we didn't! Annapurna and Everest base camps are seriously tough, and it was good to do a shorter hike for our first time so we didn't get in beyond our depth and turn around, as a lot of casual hikers visiting the Himalayas do.</div>
