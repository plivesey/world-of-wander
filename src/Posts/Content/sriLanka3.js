                <div>After skipping down Sri Lanka's <a href="https://worldofwander.app/post/srilanka-south-coast">south coast from Colombo</a> then taking the train across a lush green landscape from <a href="https://worldofwander.app/post/srilanka-ella-kandy">Ella</a>, we left ourselves a "do nothing" day in Kandy. After breakfast at our homestay and a ride from our host into town, we hunkered down at Empire Cafe for some serious catch-up computer time. My goals for the day were to figure out where we were going and sleeping for the next five or six days, and to download, sort, and edit the hundreds of photos I'd already taken. Those two tasks took several hours, and we stayed at the cafe through lunch and the afternoon.</div>

                <div>We had thought we might really like Kandy and want to hang out there for a couple more days, but it turned out to be a larger and less interesting city than anticipated. So, I took a look at Google Maps and zoomed into the green areas around Kandy. Nearby was Knuckles Forest Reserve, which I looked up on TripAdvisor. One of the reviews mentioned a <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304138-d13071974-Reviews-Nipuna_Knuckles_Trekking-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html">Nipuna Trekking</a>, who I emailed, and an hour later we were set for a two day trek starting in the morning.</div>

                <div>For the first day of the trek, we joined a couple doing a day hike. Gwen and Andrew were from Ireland, and were enjoying the hot weather but struggling with it as much as we were. Our 15 kilometer hike started off as more of an educational nature walk as our guide, Janaka, pointed out a fruit-bearing tree or vine every 15 feet or so. We joked we were never going to make it at that rate, but it was cool to see what tamarind and peppercorns look like in the wild.</div>

                <div>We climbed upward through rice paddies and villages, stopping in shade whenever we could. Our lunch spot was a very cool waterfall clear and deep enough to jump into. The ice-cold mountain water was very welcome by that point! Janaka had arranged boxed lunches for us – a common Sri Lankan meal of white rice with a variety of vegetable-based curries (green bean, beetroot, and banana flower) plus a bit of chicken. When we had the same meal the next day and tossed the bones to a dog who had been following us, we were shocked when it chomped down the bones and swallowed them in just a few bites. Dogs can eat whole bones??</div>

                <div>After the waterfall, we thought we might get some downhill... and we were wrong. It turned out that most of the 15 km was an upward ascent towards a giant rockface that gave us a view of the valley. We said goodbye to Gwen and Andrew back at the main road – they were getting a jeep ride back to Kandy. Janaka then led us another 4 kilometers on to the campsite. By this point we were dehydrated, sunburned on top of our original sunburns, and very tired. Knuckles Base Camp, our stop for the night, was a welcome sight.</div>

                <div>The camp is fairly new and only partially completed; it will hold 100 people when finished. Our little area had four very nice tents with sleeping bags and pads set up under half-open protective roof and walls, and a couple of nice newly constructed huts for the guides. We only met two other hikers, Sarah and Hannah, who had just finished lawyer training with their U.K. firm in Singapore. Hannah was traveling for two months before heading back to full-time corporate law in London, but Sarah had decided that life wasn't for her and had quit her job after training. She hoped instead to enter a master's program in Asian Studies in the fall, and wasn't sure what she'd do until then. Three people who have quit their jobs are probably a bad influence on the one holdout... sorry, Hannah! (But quitting your corporate job can be a great thing!)</div>

                <div>The two girls had just finished their second out of three days of hiking. For their last day, they had intended the same route we had planned: 22 km to the summit of Knuckles Range and back down. But they were also exhausted, and decided instead to skip and just hike out to meet up with their car. This made us somewhat nervous about going forward with a 22 km day after having just been wiped out by 19 km, but we (Peter in particular – I'll confess I suggested a few times we could easily back out) were committed.</div>

                <div>It took us nearly 9 hours to complete the hike, but was very much worth it to stand on the highest point in Sri Lanka. It helped that we got out early at 8 a.m. and were blessed with a partially cloudy, yet not rainy day. Hiking through a humid jungle is no joke! My favorite moment came when Janaka suggested we deviate from the path a bit to visit another waterfall – and it had a spectacular view out across the valley. By the way, while we were wearing sweat-wicking, lightweight hiking-appropriate clothes and heavy-duty hiking boots, Janaka did the whole thing in slacks, a button down, and loafers. Without socks. And then told us it was his seventh day in a a row of hiking 20 km. And that he didn't yet know if he would have to hike again tomorrow – he'd find out when we got to the end and called his boss for a pickup.</div>

                <div>Peter and I were most certainly not heading out for any more hiking. While I would have loved to camp again that night – it was so peaceful and restorative – we instead scarfed down a meal at 5 p.m., went back to our homestay, and I promptly fell asleep while Peter ate a second dinner downstairs. Seems like <a href="https://worldofwander.app/post/nepal">the Himalayas</a> didn't fully prepare us for the rigors of hiking in a tropical climate!</div>
