                <div>When we lived in Mountain View, Peter found a tiny man-made lake near the salt flats and signed up for ten rental sessions. He had sailed as a child; his dad is a yachtmaster (a technical designation and also a cool title) and Peter had loved the sailing vacations the family took. I'm not sure we used all ten sessions, because the tiny lake quickly became tiresome when you needed to change directions constantly going back and forth.</div>

I had thought that was the only boating experience I needed to have going forward. When Peter's parents suggested renting a yacht for a week at the Isle of Wight, I was on board – picturing smooth sailing and lots of Pimm's. </div>

                <div>An hour in, as the boat pitched at a 45 degree angle (ok fine, probably 20 degrees) and I cowered trying not to be sick, I wasn't so sure. Luckily the week turned out to be fantastic and we've already planned our next trip. We were also stupidly lucky with the sunny weather. Sailing in England is supposed to be a dreary, wet occasion, and we had even bought massive waterproof overalls for it. </div>

            text: (
                <div>Tacking happens when you turn the boat, causing the wind to hit the other side of the sail. This moves the sail to the other side of the boat, and the boat switches the direction it's leaning. If you're headed at a good (30-50 degree angle) to the direction the wind is blowing, it's easy. You use the steering wheel and keep the wind on the same side of the sail. But if you're headed upwind or downwind, you'll have a problem. The wind has to catch the sails from the side, so it can't fill the sails if it's hitting the boat from the front or back. So, you zigzag across the line of wind to make sure the wind is filling the sails and propelling the boat forward.</div>

                <div>Because sailing can be so inefficient (see above), sometimes you get stuck with no wind and have to turn on the motor to keep moving. Most sailboats are equipped with a motor because it's difficult to put down an anchor without one, and basically impossible to get in and out of a marina. I suppose this one is obvious in retrospect, but I it's not something I'd thought about at all before learning how to put down an anchor. I have a renewed respect for Pirates of the Caribbean-esque boats now knowing how difficult maneuvering can be.</div>

                <div>The mechanics of how to make a sailboat move in a given direction are easy enough to understand and practice, but that's a small portion of mastering the seas. Navigation can be immensely difficult, and this is another point on which I'm in awe of the Pirates of the Caribbean. To get from point A to B is not just looking at the map and making a straight line. You have to time coming in and out of inlets or bays with the direction the tides are going. We didn't plan our entire week's route beforehand so we could be flexible each day, but that meant close to half an hour of Hilary and Alastair poring over tidal maps and estimating how many knots per hour we could travel.</div>

                <div>Fun fact: ‘knots' are the nautical equipment of miles, a standard of measurement. But it's not an accidentally bad way to shorten ‘nautical' (nauts… get it?). It actually comes from when there were standard length ropes with knots at certain intervals, and boats would time how long it took to get from one knot to the next to know how fast they were going.</div>
