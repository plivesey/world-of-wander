                <div>Peter and I have been working for four weeks now, doing remote contract work for companies back in San Francisco. It's been a little bit rough working 40 hours a week after working a max of ten on personal projects for the last year, though our amazing coworking space in Sussex, <a href="https://wild.work">wild.work</a>, has made the transition a lot easier. In any case we were a little sad about not being on the road, and jumped when Peter's parents presented an opportunity to go to the Netherlands.</div>

                <div>When Peter was one year old, his family moved to the Netherlands for three years, and his brother was actually born there. They've stayed in touch with good friends there, Marjolein and Thijs, who invited them to visit – and we luckily got to tag along!</div>

                <div>Since it was my first time in the country, I wanted to spend a day in Amsterdam. After spending Friday night at Marjolein and Thijs's house in the Hague, Peter and I took a train up on Saturday morning. Of course it's crazy to try to see a whole city in one day, so I focused on wandering around two main areas with lots of fun things to see: the Old Town, and De Pijp.</div>

                <div>We arrived just before noon and started wandering through the Old Town before the weather caught us. The sky started pouring rain and umbrellas all around us were blown inside out. We took refuge under an overhang and in a very nice mall for a bit, then grabbed a streetcar train down to De Pijp. The public transportation systems in the Netherlands are some of the best I've ever seen – clean, high accessibility across the cities and counties, on time, and not crowded. We did pay 8 Euros each for a day pass which is steep for our standards after Southeast Asia, but that's just fine with me for excellent transportation!</div>

                <div>In De Pijp, we headed straight for Albert Cuyp Market ready to try every Dutch specialty we saw. After five food stands, I think we succeeded! First up were poffertjes, like mini pancakes but much more buttery, and traditionally eaten with just powdered sugar on top. They're made in a special pan with several rows of little pancake holes. As we stood watching the street vendor expertly and quickly flip the poffertjes over to cook the second side, an Irishman next to us leaned in and said, "I can't tell if this is awesome just because it's awesome, or awesome because I'm high." Ah, Amsterdam.</div>

                <div>Next up, a main course: a chicken sandwich so tender and juicy we didn't need any sauce on it. Then we headed for the most intriguing item on the menu: haring. It's called "raw herring" but is actually cured in a way that doesn't leave it salty at all, though it tastes sort of like eating raw fish. It's served with raw onions and pickles, and we enjoyed it!</div>

                <div>Then it was on to a food Peter remembered from when he was tiny: frites, or fries. In the Netherlands the special way they serve them is in a paper cone with "fritessaus" (fry sauce), essentially mayonnaise. However, the fritessaus had a ton of sugar added, and we actually didn't like this one at all. Luckily, we ended on a high note: stroopwafel, that delicious export you get at Trader Joe's in round white and blue tins. It's definitely better made fresh with hot caramel.</div>

                <div>We wandered through the neighborhood for a bit, and then made our way to the museum area. We tried to go to the Van Gogh museum, which everyone had recommended – but they'd actually run out of tickets for the entire weekend. Lesson learned: Europe in the summer is busy! We looked at the Rijks Museum but decided instead to walk through Vondelpark, a large public park with tons of bikers and people walking around. It was only sunny for tiny 20-second spurts every now and then, but still pretty.</div>

                <div>Since it was still raining sporadically and was pretty windy, we decided against the classic Amsterdam bike rental. To work off our lunch bonanza, we walked back up to the Old Town to spend more time on the canals. I had bookmarked a few particularly pretty spots but we generally had a lot of fun just exploring random streets. We did accidentally wander through the Red Light district at one point – one minute I was marveling at murals and wondering why they said "No F*ing Photos," and the next minute I saw very clearly why. Oops.</div>

                <div>Our last stop before quick dinner and a drink at the train station was House of Bols, a museum dedicated to the classic Dutch spirit Genever, the predecessor to gin. I thought it would be fairly historical and informative and focus on the tradition of the craft, but they also threw in a lot of "experience" – like a one-person black room where you're given a tiny bottle of "mystery liquor," then a voice tells you to sip your drink while the floor vibrates and lasers make patterns over your face in a mirror. And they film it, so you all can <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/aRMAYdRKsQyum3Gq6">enjoy our faces with lasers</a> now too! Sort of like Smirnoff, there are tons of fruity and sweet spinoff flavors, and they focused a lot on those during the tour. At the end, we used drink tickets to choose cocktails in a very lounge-y bar setting. Overall, super fun and I'd definitely recommend.</div>

                <div>The rest of the group picked us up from the train that evening, and we drove an hour and a half north into Friesland. I still can't believe how incredibly flat the country is – I've never seen anything like it. Not even little hills! You can see for miles. From Marjolein and Thijs's place in the Hague on the top floor, we could actually see Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and the ocean.</div>

                <div>Their vacation house was next to a national park, and the entire region was covered in little lakes and canals. The typical Friessian countryside is a canal with a beautiful green field behind it, cows grazing, and the mast of a sailboat popping up from the next canal over. Everyone there grows up boating – sailboats and motorboats – and there were a few houses accessible only by boat.</div>

                <div>On Sunday, Thijs captained us out in the motorboat for a day trip to the town of Sneek. Our boat was actually short enough that we could pass under the old bridges in the towns we passed through, but just barely. It was truly an idyllic day with beautiful countryside, picnic sandwiches, and of course a bottle of white on the boat. In Sneek we explored the town a bit and got out of the wind to soak up some sun at a bar. I saw a sign mentioning "Fryslân" instead of "Friesland," and learned they have their own regional language, which is so different that Dutch people can't even understand it!</div>

                <div>On Monday, Hilary and Alastair took the sailboat out, and Peter and I finally got our Dutch bike-riding experience. The biking culture there is amazing, and pretty unique – there are bike paths everywhere and it's common for people not to drive cars, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NA6e7AHJck">even in the winter</a> – and they strap babies onto the fronts of bikes with little windshields! This area of Friesland had tons of walking/biking paths for miles around along the canals, and you could go for a whole day if you wanted. We started at an observation point, then took a bike ferry across one of the canals and continued down the other side. An example of countryside friendliness: we forgot money, but the ferry master let us on anyway. We took another round trip to drop off the fee later.</div>
