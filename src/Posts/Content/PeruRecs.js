                <div>When I was planning our trip to Peru, I asked everyone I knew had been there (plus some strangers in cafes) for recommendations. I got so many awesome ones for restaurants, neighborhoods, bars, and places to stay, I wanted to share the compilation so that anyone else thinking of going can use it!</div>

                <div>Caveat: I couldn't get reservations at Maido, Central, or Marcelo Batata, which I'm sure would have made my favorites. But we ate and drank at some amazing spots!
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Canta Ranita</b>, Lima (Barranco): Brunchy cevicheria hidden in the back of a local market</li>
                        <li><b>Palacio del Inka</b>, Cusco: A splurge hotel with beautiful decor, a perfect location, and daily pisco sour classes in the schmancy lounge</li>
                        <li><b>Juanito's</b>, Cusco (San Blas): Hole-in-the-wall, utterly amazing chicharrones sandwiches. Don't mess with the menu options, just get the real thing.</li>
                        <li><b>Limo</b>, Cusco: Japanese-Peruvian fusion</li>

                        <li><b>Cala</b>, Lima: I made a <a href="http://calarestaurante.com/">reservation</a> one month in advance, and found out when we got there I'd made it for the wrong day. We were early enough in the evening (Americans eat far earlier than Peruvians) that they were still able to seat us on the balcony overlooking the ocean. Great selection of seafood and Italian-esque dishes.</li>

                        <li>Everyone says to rush through Lima, but take 1-2 days because 1) there are so many awesome places to eat and drink, and you can only fit so many sandwiches and cocktails into your waking hours and 2) travel delays are frequent (happened to us both from US and from Cusco) so if you only allow for 12 hours, that will likely get cut down.</li>
                        <li>Neighborhoods we stayed in: Miraflores (upscale, some of the best restaurants) and Barranco (artsy, close to beach, tons of murals and converted colonial houses.)</li>
